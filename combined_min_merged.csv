Conversation Management;a queue of cars, right
Conversation Management;alright
Conversation Management;alright.
Conversation Management;alright. okay
Conversation Management;alright.1
Conversation Management;i believe we can.
Conversation Management;it seems like it
Conversation Management;it's distributed, okay.
Conversation Management;oh, right
Conversation Management;okay
Conversation Management;okay so
Conversation Management;okay,
Conversation Management;okay, alright
Conversation Management;okay, i like that.
Conversation Management;okay, yeah.
Conversation Management;okay.
Conversation Management;right
Conversation Management;right,
Conversation Management;right, and then figure out
Conversation Management;right, right
Conversation Management;right, yeah
Conversation Management;right.
Conversation Management;right. exactly.
Conversation Management;right. okay
Conversation Management;so maybe this is public and this is private in the sensethat you only ever have roads in the network when it's at theintersections because i don't think, i'm trying to
Conversation Management;so they can build on.
Conversation Management;so, controller -ê okay
Conversation Management;sure. sure, so let's establish
Conversation Management;that's right.
Conversation Management;that's true.
Conversation Management;well, that could be, maybe the cop -
Conversation Management;yeah
Conversation Management;yeah and also
Conversation Management;yeah okay
Conversation Management;yeah sure
Conversation Management;yeah there could be two
Conversation Management;yeah,
Conversation Management;yeah, exactly.
Conversation Management;yeah, it's a little messy
Conversation Management;yeah, it's a lot of rules, right.
Conversation Management;yeah, right, right
Conversation Management;yeah, right. right
Conversation Management;yeah, that makes sense
Conversation Management;yeah, that's right.
Conversation Management;yeah, yeah
Conversation Management;yeah.
Conversation Management;you're right, so let's write it
Conversation Management;blocks
Conversation Management;exactly
Conversation Management;exactly,
Conversation Management;exactly, exactly
Conversation Management;exactly, exactly.
Conversation Management;furthermore, like more details.
Conversation Management;i got it, yeah.
Conversation Management;i know,
Conversation Management;i understand
Conversation Management;lets assume this
Conversation Management;no, no
Conversation Management;oh yes
Conversation Management;right, righ
Conversation Management;so i guess roads, intersections
Conversation Management;so i guess you would say that
Conversation Management;that's true
Conversation Management;there's intersections, and streets,
Conversation Management;these are the patterns
Conversation Management;this is a real?time table
Conversation Management;we could do it like that
Conversation Management;ya
Conversation Management;yeah, everyone has a light
Conversation Management;yeah, that's probably enough
Conversation Management;yeah, they're there
Conversation Management;yeah, well...
Conversation Management;yeah, yeah.
Conversation Management;yes
Conversation Management;you go ahead.
Conversation Management;absolutely, yeah
Conversation Management;exactly, so
Conversation Management;exactly, yeah
Conversation Management;exactly, yes,
Conversation Management;gotcha. okay, makes sense
Conversation Management;let's talk about that.
Conversation Management;okay, cool
Conversation Management;okay, cool.
Conversation Management;okay, so
Conversation Management;okay, yeah well that makes sense
Conversation Management;perfect okay
Conversation Management;put this signal here
Conversation Management;right, we don't care
Conversation Management;sensor, and
Conversation Management;well it'sÇ-its going to be significant
Conversation Management;well there's a speed component, yes
Conversation Management;whoever starts using it, yeah.
Conversation Management;yeah exactly.
Conversation Management;yeah i think you're right
Conversation Management;yeah i'm trying to get
Conversation Management;yeah we can do
Conversation Management;yeah, makes sense.
Conversation Management;yeah, that works.
Conversation Management;yeah, that's it
Conversation Management;yeah. i'm pretty sure
Conversation Management;yeah. okay cool
Conversation Management;yep.
Conversation Management;yes, exactly
Conversation Management;endpoint is okay
Conversation Management;fair enough.
Conversation Management;itís alright.
Conversation Management;no
Conversation Management;no itís not
Conversation Management;okay. now i can see something
Conversation Management;so far itís okay.
Conversation Management;sure
Conversation Management;sure,
Conversation Management;sure.
Conversation Management;sure. sure.
Conversation Management;thatís fine
Conversation Management;yea
Conversation Management;yea, yes.
Conversation Management;yes i Creative Conflict
Conversation Management;yes i can read it
Conversation Management;yes i got it. we can do that.
Conversation Management;yes i like that idea
Conversation Management;yes i removed it
Conversation Management;yes itís fine.
Conversation Management;yes okay
Conversation Management;yes okay.
Conversation Management;yes that sounds good
Conversation Management;yes you are right.
Conversation Management;yes you can start.
Conversation Management;yes,
Conversation Management;yes, iím just trying to understand what you are writing.
Conversation Management;yes, itís a property of the intersection
Conversation Management;yes, okay
Conversation Management;yes, sounds good
Conversation Management;yes, sure
Conversation Management;yes, sure i do.
Conversation Management;yes.
Conversation Management;ah, ok
Conversation Management;ah, ok, yeah
Conversation Management;exactly, maybe this should be, i mean.
Conversation Management;exactly, yes
Conversation Management;in the four, yeah
Conversation Management;it seems so
Conversation Management;ok
Conversation Management;ok,
Conversation Management;so i am, yeah exactly,
Conversation Management;so, thatís exactly, i guess we need it for each
Conversation Management;yeah that's what i was thinking about when i said
Conversation Management;yeah yeah
Conversation Management;yeah, exactly
Conversation Management;yeah, exactly,
Conversation Management;yeah, iíll go on
Conversation Management;yeah, thatís fine
Conversation Management;yeah, thatís ok for me
Conversation Management;yeah, thatís right
Conversation Management;yeah, thatís right, thatís in two, requirement 2, part c, i think, yes
Conversation Management;yeah, thatís the thing, so in terms
Conversation Management;yeah, thatís what i am thinking.
Conversation Management;yeah, thatís whatís my first impression
Conversation Management;yeah, this could be a good option
Conversation Management;yeah, yeah, draw
Conversation Management;yeah, yeah, thatís fine for me too
Conversation Management;yep
Conversation Management;yes, ah, ok, right now i can see them
Conversation Management;yes, exactly that was what i was
Conversation Management;yes, exactly, yeah i think thatís the best way
Conversation Management;yes, thatís right
Conversation Management;yes, thatís right, i Creative Conflict, so we should probably draw it bigger so we can include more information in kind of symbols they draw.
Conversation Management;yes, you are connected, yes
Conversation Management;you can draw it
Conversation Management;a queue of cars, right
Conversation Management;alright
Conversation Management;alright.
Conversation Management;alright. okay
Conversation Management;alright.1
Conversation Management;cop, we'd have kind of a cop object that youcould manipulate certain rule sets. or is that implicit in[inaudible
Conversation Management;i believe we can.
Conversation Management;it has a tick and the tick method really then says i thinkwe're going to time this happened, i'm going to go check my[inaudible] and i'm going to kick off, so its like we're sayingthat this is a traverser.
Conversation Management;it seems like it
Conversation Management;it's almost like the intersection has a state
Conversation Management;it's distributed, okay.
Conversation Management;my first inclination is to say, okay the rules if rules can getpushed into the objects and then tick maybe into the--distribute the rules into the network and then at every tickeach aspect, each car gets a tick, each intersection gets atick, each road gets a tick.
Conversation Management;no
Conversation Management;oh, right
Conversation Management;okay
Conversation Management;okay so
Conversation Management;okay,
Conversation Management;okay, alright
Conversation Management;okay, i like that.
Conversation Management;okay, yeah.
Conversation Management;okay.
Conversation Management;random number generator is controlling push. andthat happens for every tick.
Conversation Management;right
Conversation Management;right,
Conversation Management;right, and then figure out
Conversation Management;right, right
Conversation Management;right, yeah
Conversation Management;right.
Conversation Management;right. exactly.
Conversation Management;right. okay
Conversation Management;so maybe this is public and this is private in the sensethat you only ever have roads in the network when it's at theintersections because i don't think, i'm trying to
Conversation Management;so they can build on.
Conversation Management;so, controller -ê okay
Conversation Management;sure. sure, so let's establish
Conversation Management;that's right.
Conversation Management;that's true.
Conversation Management;there might be an implicitstep in the network to say to keep the network modelconstraints by introducing an intersection if it needs to at ajunction
Conversation Management;well that's a good point, though,
Conversation Management;well, that could be, maybe the cop -
Conversation Management;yeah
Conversation Management;yeah and also
Conversation Management;yeah okay
Conversation Management;yeah sure
Conversation Management;yeah there could be two
Conversation Management;yeah,
Conversation Management;yeah, exactly.
Conversation Management;yeah, it's a little messy
Conversation Management;yeah, it's a lot of rules, right.
Conversation Management;yeah, right, right
Conversation Management;yeah, right. right
Conversation Management;yeah, that makes sense
Conversation Management;yeah, that's right.
Conversation Management;yeah, yeah
Conversation Management;yeah.
Conversation Management;you're right, so let's write it
Conversation Management;blocks
Conversation Management;exactly
Conversation Management;exactly,
Conversation Management;exactly, exactly
Conversation Management;exactly, exactly.
Conversation Management;from when you start it one way until you all the way tothe end to the next light? but it seems like sensors couldimpact that,
Conversation Management;furthermore, like more details.
Conversation Management;i got it, yeah.
Conversation Management;i know,
Conversation Management;i understand
Conversation Management;lets assume this
Conversation Management;no, no
Conversation Management;oh yes
Conversation Management;right, righ
Conversation Management;so i guess roads, intersections
Conversation Management;so i guess you would say that
Conversation Management;that's true
Conversation Management;there's intersections, and streets,
Conversation Management;these are the patterns
Conversation Management;this is a real?time table
Conversation Management;we could do it like that
Conversation Management;ya
Conversation Management;yeah, because that's a huge wrinkle if it's not.
Conversation Management;yeah, everyone has a light
Conversation Management;yeah, that's probably enough
Conversation Management;yeah, they're there
Conversation Management;yeah, well...
Conversation Management;yeah, yeah.
Conversation Management;yes

Conversation Management;yeah, that's it

Conversation Management;yeah. okay cool
Conversation Management;yep.
Conversation Management;yes, exactly
Conversation Management;ah no
Conversation Management;endpoint is okay
Conversation Management;fair enough.
Conversation Management;is that okay?
Conversation Management;itís alright.
Conversation Management;no itís not
Conversation Management;okay. now i can see something
Conversation Management;so far itís okay.
Conversation Management;sure
Conversation Management;sure,
Conversation Management;sure.
Conversation Management;sure. sure.
Conversation Management;thanks a lot, thatís a compliment.
Conversation Management;thanks for the time, it was a nice design time so to say.
Conversation Management;thatís fine
Conversation Management;yea
Conversation Management;yea, yes.
Conversation Management;yes i Creative Conflict
Conversation Management;yes i can read it
Conversation Management;yes i got it. we can do that.
Conversation Management;yes i like that idea

Conversation Management;yes, itís a property of the intersection
Conversation Management;yes, okay
Conversation Management;yes, sounds good
Conversation Management;yes, sure
Conversation Management;yes, sure i do.
Conversation Management;yes, you too, thank you very much. it was fun.
Conversation Management;yes.
Conversation Management;ah, ok
Conversation Management;ah, ok, yeah
Conversation Management;exactly, maybe this should be, i mean.
Conversation Management;exactly, yes
Conversation Management;in the four, yeah
Conversation Management;it seems so
Conversation Management;ok
Conversation Management;ok,
Conversation Management;so i am, yeah exactly,

Conversation Management;yes, thatís right, i Creative Conflict, so we should probably draw it bigger so we can include more information in kind of symbols they draw.
Conversation Management;yes, you are connected, yes
Conversation Management;you can draw it
Creative Conflict;i think you're right saying the light knows the state of is therea car there
Creative Conflict;that's true.
Creative Conflict;i would somehow separate it too
Creative Conflict;no
Creative Conflict;so that's what i was getting at
Creative Conflict;that's kind of good down here
Creative Conflict;yeah
Creative Conflict;yeah, because it has to be adjusted to however fast you canpossibly be going
Creative Conflict;it think so. yeah, i Creative Conflict.
Creative Conflict;yeah, because it could you know
Creative Conflict;i Creative Conflict on that
Creative Conflict;traffic is not visualized really, and we could also have a visualization of the traffic, could make sense
Creative Conflict;you are right, based on the current things it doesnít make too much sense that you have this reuse of traffic
Creative Conflict;exactly
Creative Conflict;ok, yeah
Creative Conflict;thatís right, i Creative Conflict, so we should
Creative Conflict;yeah i mean it would be interesting because then you can create more complex pattern and so, or sequences or more than one traffic light.
Creative Conflict;yeah so then we should be able to connect them somehow.
Creative Conflict;yeah, exactly
Creative Conflict;yeah, exactly, thatís what i mean,
Creative Conflict;yeah, yeah
Conversation Management;i'm sorry
Conversation Management;again sorry for my handwriting
Conversation Management;ah sorry
Conversation Management;iím sorry about my handwriting
Conversation Management;sorry for my handwriting
Conversation Management;sorry i have
Conversation Management;sorry.
Conversation Management;i am sorry for this ugly appearance
Conversation Management;so i am sorry for that
Conversation Management;sorry
Conversation Management;well that's a good point, though,
Conversation Management;is that okay?
Conversation Management;thanks a lot, thatís a compliment.
Conversation Management;thanks for the time, it was a nice design time so to say.
Conversation Management;yes, you too, thank you very much. it was fun.
Creative Conflict;but it's not necessarily realistic
Creative Conflict;but the light would then have to
Creative Conflict;but then there's
Creative Conflict;but you know
Creative Conflict;i don't know
Creative Conflict;i don't know how to actually structure this
Creative Conflict;if we control whether certain intersections evenallow a [inaudible
Creative Conflict;it should bepossible to create a busy road or a seldom used one, or any 0variation in between.
Creative Conflict;okay so it says that's up to us
Creative Conflict;or, at leastde
Creative Conflict;so dowe want to have visualization of cars moving along aparticular road in a geometric sense?
Creative Conflict;so now the push is not just the random numbergenerator for frequency, but there's also random numbergenerator for zero one for left versus right
Creative Conflict;wonder if atfirst approximation never [inaudible] in roads.
Creative Conflict;, but whatabout the--how
Creative Conflict;. so add road could potentially have, what's theplace you could ever, you did this.
Creative Conflict;. which would be a horizontalflow or a vertical flow
Creative Conflict;and have uml diagram for the class structureof each object's attributes
Creative Conflict;and i wonder
Creative Conflict;aroad is an interior or we should call it an onramp
Creative Conflict;but
Creative Conflict;but also it'sanalytic data saying okay you're still in this queue
Creative Conflict;but beginning when youjust
Creative Conflict;but i imagine the controller controls that, right, the modelbasically is just the basically cars, the queue of cars, theintersection contains four queues.
Creative Conflict;but i think that would become a bit spaghetti
Creative Conflict;but if you
Creative Conflict;but let's leave observe
Creative Conflict;but not necessarilyall red.
Creative Conflict;but only if
Creative Conflict;but roads
Creative Conflict;but should readily accommodate six intersections--okayso we can actually accommodate [inaudible] larger
Creative Conflict;but that, but this simulation
Creative Conflict;but the push is really
Creative Conflict;but then let's
Creative Conflict;but then there's horizontal-êleft,vertical-êleft.
Creative Conflict;but then we can
Creative Conflict;but we've
Creative Conflict;but what
Creative Conflict;butthen
Creative Conflict;butwhat's--i'd imagine
Creative Conflict;cop, we'd have kind of a cop object that youcould manipulate certain rule sets. or is that implicit in[inaudible
Creative Conflict;create a road there's no intersection, so road existsoutside of the intersection
Creative Conflict;do you want to keep it or do you want to do two queues.
Creative Conflict;i don't know if this isany better
Creative Conflict;i mean i'm wondering could youadd
Creative Conflict;i suppose if you just had a list of intersections it goesrandomly too
Creative Conflict;i think you're right saying the light knows the state of is therea car there
Creative Conflict;i wonder if
Creative Conflict;if it's a single lane of traffic, could those left-êturners andstraight-êthrough-êers be queued up in the same queue
Creative Conflict;if that state is this, then the otherstates are going to be
Creative Conflict;if the car at thehead of, well the entrance. i guess
Creative Conflict;if there's a protected left turn thenthese need to be broken up almost.
Creative Conflict;if they have an intersection here and here
Creative Conflict;if this is ourcanvass and that's an onramp and that's an off ramp, youhave a special edge intersection
Creative Conflict;if this road fills up, then even if this is green,this car won't be able to pass
Creative Conflict;if we ever really neededthis
Creative Conflict;if we had some sort of--our network can be representedwith a geometry that's in kind of the window so you canscroll around
Creative Conflict;if we haveintersection then they know about them
Creative Conflict;if we make the capacity of the geometry and youcould sort of simulate a highway or something
Creative Conflict;if we want to
Creative Conflict;if we want to get more sophisticated wecould have sensor logic taking sensor for each in-êroad so thatif say these two are empty then these two just stay greenforever
Creative Conflict;if we were playing the roles ofarchitect, how to communicate it to--so we
Creative Conflict;if you could rearrange the networks to get thatslope, you would have
Creative Conflict;if you double click you can controlthe frequency of the car creation on that road
Creative Conflict;if you gothrough that's fine and then through that's fine.
Creative Conflict;if you have multiple lanesthen you could say the left one is always turning left
Creative Conflict;if you look at a road. it has a queue, right
Creative Conflict;if you say you have to start with anonramp
Creative Conflict;if you're thinking graphically, if this iscapacity and wait time, the capacity is going to be graphedsomething like that
Creative Conflict;if you're visiting anintersection and a road you don't have to be those thingsthere, all that logic is pretty clear there
Creative Conflict;if youwant to take control, i'd have you say
Creative Conflict;ifyou want to make it longer or shorter
Creative Conflict;i'm notquite sure
Creative Conflict;is the cop really a model or is that acontroller
Creative Conflict;is this all this sort of master control orwhatever? or should that go into where you push rulesdown to
Creative Conflict;it depends if there's two lanes or not.
Creative Conflict;it has a tick, tick, tick, or are we saying that alltick logic methods have a combo
Creative Conflict;it might be, or another alternative
Creative Conflict;it would have multiple lanes so thatin a sense it has multiple queues
Creative Conflict;it's almost as if you need to always start with an onramp sothat
Creative Conflict;it's not full it would be allowed to
Creative Conflict;just wonder if maybe the important
Creative Conflict;let's supposeto you do here to here onramp, off ramp. and so this pointnow we can get an interior, now we've got an interior.
Creative Conflict;let'ssuppose we make it so every ten ticks the lights change.well, it might be that every five ticks, the sensor is triggered,or something like that.
Creative Conflict;like so that you've got this intersection next to thisintersection and if this road fills up, then even
Creative Conflict;maybe ifyou select a car, i mean a road, it allows you to edit
Creative Conflict;now i'm wondering like the rule for changing the lights,we established a rule saying the light, are we going to saylight would change to green, or will only stay red for xamount of time, or is it reversed
Creative Conflict;numerical decision data. averagewait time, three hours. and i wonder if we want to allowuser control of a clock in the sense that relating the notion ofthis tick time to real time.
Creative Conflict;okayone tick so from two to one, we go to zero
Creative Conflict;one car or two
Creative Conflict;or a left protection
Creative Conflict;or analyzing the average wait time of a given car, right
Creative Conflict;or are all the opposing lanesalways the same state
Creative Conflict;or are we lettingthe video camera capture that description
Creative Conflict;or if
Creative Conflict;or if we
Creative Conflict;or is this inside of a ui
Creative Conflict;or we could even have
Creative Conflict;or yeah i guess speed of cars, rate of incoming cars onthe onramp
Creative Conflict;or you could say
Creative Conflict;or you could start from the outside in and say, well for everyunbounded road,
Creative Conflict;or you've got
Creative Conflict;or, i want to run it on--run a simulation for some amount oftime and evaluate the network
Creative Conflict;or, wait. well that's [inaudible] one cargoes per tick.
Creative Conflict;property of the queue or a property of thecar
Creative Conflict;right so this is now a ui piece and the dot, brings up youreditor with frequency of, your frequency value
Creative Conflict;say if this is the head. sothe speed controls, like for every tick how many spaces a carcan move
Creative Conflict;so
Creative Conflict;so all these lines of
Creative Conflict;so clock is a controller
Creative Conflict;so do you want
Creative Conflict;so for every tick, the analytics guy does asweep, collecting statistical data about the state of each tick
Creative Conflict;so foreach road in the simulation we look at the car at the head ofthe queue
Creative Conflict;so get rid of this
Creative Conflict;so highlight
Creative Conflict;so i
Creative Conflict;so i can see traffic flow across it.
Creative Conflict;so i think that might bethe best way to communicate interaction design.
Creative Conflict;so i think that's
Creative Conflict;so i was thinking
Creative Conflict;so if the
Creative Conflict;so i'll use a soliddot to mean ownership and then an open dot to meanreferencing. so the network owns the roads, the networkowns the intersections but the intersection can referencethese in and out roads. alright, so i guess we need, addroad
Creative Conflict;so i'm thinking maybe
Creative Conflict;so instead of just a straight
Creative Conflict;so is there someone looking at the networksaying the average congestion is, or the average wait time ofa car is,
Creative Conflict;so it might be thatthe road has some number of, an ordered list of cars that aremoving along the road and only when they get to the end ofthe road do they get pushed into the queue.
Creative Conflict;so it should
Creative Conflict;so it's a visit
Creative Conflict;so it's got to be just a grid likethat. that's fine.
Creative Conflict;so it's like8you're inferring intersection at crossings.
Creative Conflict;so it's saying at each tick we see where the problems occurand maybe make a road blink red if it's full and
Creative Conflict;so i've got two car lengths
Creative Conflict;so let's
Creative Conflict;so let's suppose t onerepresent a delta
Creative Conflict;so max cars, holds n.1
Creative Conflict;so maybe
Creative Conflict;so maybe it'sreally a function of the result of how the intersections arelaid out. and the relationship between the intersection. 8
Creative Conflict;so maybe this is public and this is private in the sensethat you only ever have roads in the network when it's at theintersections because i don't think, i'm trying to
Creative Conflict;so maybe we
Creative Conflict;so mostly straight and sometimes
Creative Conflict;so next userstory
Creative Conflict;so that comes back toanalytics right?
Creative Conflict;so that kind of comes into car
Creative Conflict;so that thisintersection is connected to this one, or is that
Creative Conflict;so that would
Creative Conflict;so that you
Creative Conflict;so that's just the function or the property on thelight
Creative Conflict;so that's one thing, and also like how longthese signals stay green
Creative Conflict;so that's the basic way to kick it all off i guess
Creative Conflict;so the cop as,
Creative Conflict;so the empty network is what we started outwith a blank page, as they drag a road on, that instantiates aroad object
Creative Conflict;so the only other way youcan get through
Creative Conflict;so the pop
Creative Conflict;so the random number
Creative Conflict;so then you drag
Creative Conflict;so then, so suppose, so we're going to have thecars done in one tic right.
Creative Conflict;so therandom
Creative Conflict;so there needs to be some logic about, wellthat's interesting so there's a notion of the road in, road out.
Creative Conflict;so there's through here, off ramp and onramp right
Creative Conflict;so this is interesting, so now should allow for roads of anylength to be placed
Creative Conflict;so this network or graph hasadditional constraints.
Creative Conflict;so this one piece of state we haven't captured is whether aroad is an interior or we should call it an onramp
Creative Conflict;so this whole thing we should talk about road, got this modelcontrol or
Creative Conflict;so we
Creative Conflict;so we almost don't need a--well, we need car to havesomething in the queue
Creative Conflict;so we could come
Creative Conflict;so we makeroads, right. so one m of intersections and we would haveroad connected to the intersection or the intersection has2paths
Creative Conflict;so we need to communicate the interaction
Creative Conflict;so we want to, you know, does thishappen basically.
Creative Conflict;so wecould introduce a notion of speed into our queue
Creative Conflict;so we're
Creative Conflict;so we're getting some credit collection of rules here
Creative Conflict;so we've created a basic [inaudible] for it to run in.
Creative Conflict;so we've got a great
Creative Conflict;so when it comes
Creative Conflict;so where you
Creative Conflict;so you can't
Creative Conflict;so you click an
Creative Conflict;so you have a consistent road network.
Creative Conflict;so you have to explain
Creative Conflict;so you want the
Creative Conflict;so youcould simplify
Creative Conflict;so you're
Creative Conflict;so you're just doing it
Creative Conflict;so, go ahead
Creative Conflict;so, let's suppose we start with, say this picture is t zero.what would, okay so they can't, let's suppose for a momentthat t zero has all the lights about to change, so in the sensethat wherever i just point in time nothing's moving and we'reshowing x point in time where something has moved sort ofbefore and after state.
Creative Conflict;so, something happens as an external controller is ticking themodel
Creative Conflict;sodoes it have a sensor, yes, no
Creative Conflict;somenumber of--so it has, think of this as kilometers, or carlengths.
Creative Conflict;sothat we
Creative Conflict;sothis can be bigger than the window so scrolling, stuff likethat
Creative Conflict;suppose you have even a simulationobject, it has a clock and a network and here's the clock andit tells the clock time
Creative Conflict;thatif a car went from here--so what we'd see right now in ourvisualization is that in queue we see it pop to the front of thequeue
Creative Conflict;that's true.
Creative Conflict;then this guy would have a state. it's like okay i'vebeen in this state for two ticks, go to three don't change, goto four change, something like that. right, so this guy has anotion of the state of the light but also time and currentstate, right. so, the clock ticks, the cop says look at whatlights are green, one tick means one car goes through so wepop off the end of the queue, we say the cop notices the endof the intersection has been in this state for one tick so nochange needs to be made. and then we get the same greenstate
Creative Conflict;there might be an implicitstep in the network to say to keep the network modelconstraints by introducing an intersection if it needs to at ajunction
Creative Conflict;there's rules governing if you have two carsgoing into the same road, which goes first per tick,
Creative Conflict;this road is geometrically shorter, then thisessentially is saying all roads are the same length
Creative Conflict;this way, or that way
Creative Conflict;ticks per minute, orsecond. okay
Creative Conflict;we could do it that way. either that or we could make roadsdominant and then intersections really just a thing thathappens at road crossings.
Creative Conflict;well, i don't know
Creative Conflict;we're prettyconstrained in what we draw geometrically so it almostseems like it might be nice to [inaudible] the geometry fromthe simulation
Creative Conflict;we've kind of done it here, butit's kind of messy
Creative Conflict;when i hit theplay button, it kicks the ticks going and now we have all ofour random number generators feeding cars into thenetwork
Creative Conflict;you have an analyticspiece looking in and assessing questions like
Creative Conflict;you're trying to do the yield, you know trying tosimulate the yield rule, right
Creative Conflict;but how
Creative Conflict;so once the car exists
Creative Conflict;, if you click on here and double click on here then there'ssome form that
Creative Conflict;although
Creative Conflict;although wemight duplicate that down here so that they can keep track ofit
Creative Conflict;and what kind of metrics or ideas does she have aroundsuccess or failure of a given, of a simulation
Creative Conflict;ayout on here well i definitely want itred for this whole period, and definitely red while it's yellow,and then there should be a little bit of an overlap. maybesomething tha
Creative Conflict;but at the same
Creative Conflict;but given what we have we think you can start ona prototype.
Creative Conflict;but i think
Creative Conflict;but ideally you'd want to have an ability for thesystem to self?adjust so that would be like the second stagewhere you go and figure
Creative Conflict;but it's not
Creative Conflict;but the thing is
Creative Conflict;but then again
Creative Conflict;but there's not a lot of, you
Creative Conflict;buti
Creative Conflict;butthat
Creative Conflict;cars are independent ofintersections i feel
Creative Conflict;each approach has a different light, or we could putthem in pairs where the north and south approaches both havethe same light signals.
Creative Conflict;f south has a green arrow, then
Creative Conflict;i almost wonder if, i don't know.
Creative Conflict;i don't know how sensors work.
Creative Conflict;i don't know if professor e really wants that level ofdetail
Creative Conflict;i don't know if they can set thespeeds
Creative Conflict;i don't know if you can changethese as well while you're going.
Creative Conflict;i don't know if. but youalready got this on there,
Creative Conflict;i don't know so much
Creative Conflict;i don't know,
Creative Conflict;i don't know.
Creative Conflict;i don't knowthat almost feels like
Creative Conflict;i don'tknow
Creative Conflict;i don'tknow exactly how to capture this
Creative Conflict;i would somehow separate it too
Creative Conflict;if
Creative Conflict;if the speed on this street is25mph, adding relay, how long should it take you to go thisdistance
Creative Conflict;if this is green, then y
Creative Conflict;if we had alittle more time
Creative Conflict;if you want tosimulate it, you have to know
Creative Conflict;i'm not reallysure
Creative Conflict;i'm not sure.
Creative Conflict;i'm saying
Creative Conflict;i'm still thinking
Creative Conflict;is part of the intersection
Creative Conflict;it'd have to be in 60 because you'd only get [inaudible] onthe green, [inaudible] on the red
Creative Conflict;know there is an overlap when both of them are red,because people run yellow lights, and they run red lights at theend so you'd get a collision
Creative Conflict;meaninglittle dots are moving, showing you how the traffic is flowing
Creative Conflict;n red for the remainder, andthen
Creative Conflict;no
Creative Conflict;now i don't know
Creative Conflict;o
Creative Conflict;oh that's not going to quite work.
Creative Conflict;okay, so that's another thing we want to be able to specify indrawing.
Creative Conflict;or
Creative Conflict;or did i readsomething there that said it has some
Creative Conflict;or maybe allow cycleable defaults
Creative Conflict;or, again we could
Creative Conflict;or, it could be you can drawwhile you're simulating.
Creative Conflict;so i think it'sa little confusing.
Creative Conflict;so it would be 50 seconds
Creative Conflict;so it's almost lik
Creative Conflict;so it's like a drawing tool that can allow them to lay downthese intersections
Creative Conflict;so maybe that's a separate setting.
Creative Conflict;so one thing is
Creative Conflict;so that's what i was getting at
Creative Conflict;so the
Creative Conflict;so the intersection
Creative Conflict;so the traffic pattern
Creative Conflict;so then it's divided pretty much between green and...
Creative Conflict;so then this would be intersection b2.
Creative Conflict;so there is a finite number
Creative Conflict;so this can get fairly complex very fast because you have allthese intersections
Creative Conflict;so we don't need to really place traffic lights,
Creative Conflict;so you couldn't
Creative Conflict;so you're going to have
Creative Conflict;that's kind of good down here
Creative Conflict;then
Creative Conflict;there's kind of a drawing area here
Creative Conflict;this is where we still have a little doubt
Creative Conflict;well, by controlling it at an individual car level you end upcontrolling the flow
Creative Conflict;well, so one little thing besides laying out the roads. weneed some kind of visualization of the map
Creative Conflict;yeah
Creative Conflict;yeah, because it has to be adjusted to however fast you canpossibly be going
Creative Conflict;you have to have green arrow and red arrow
Creative Conflict;youhave the instance of the car, the car knows where it's going. sothe car comes, and does some sort of hand?shaking with theroad and the road knows it has this
Creative Conflict;but also at eachintersection you can say this percentage is going to do this forvarying reasons that we don't
Creative Conflict;i see the big picture, but i don't know the intersections
Creative Conflict;if it doesn't have a sensor it just assumes, justignores the poll
Creative Conflict;if we continue the hierarchy of the signals, the rules
Creative Conflict;if you envisioned some sort of[inaudible] package then there'd be sort of this thing you knowthey'd drop a leftÇ-turn signal in there, and a straight signal
Creative Conflict;if you have a light dictating left, it's always goingto be a left turn and straight and more often
Creative Conflict;so this is the left turnlane
Creative Conflict;, i'm not sure
Creative Conflict;. and so you find this flow which islike,
Creative Conflict;actually i [inaudible] should either.
Creative Conflict;actually it doesn't require them to save it actually.so theoretically it's all good memory.
Creative Conflict;and so can you hit
Creative Conflict;and so instead of going from intersection
Creative Conflict;and so this guy has this loop, this do sim loop,and these are kind of the drivers of the system
Creative Conflict;and so we think about, termination of, do we get flow out of thissystem, do we think about
Creative Conflict;basically this needs tomodel a set of use cases.
Creative Conflict;but at
Creative Conflict;but do we really want to stopthe number of cars it keeps queuing up
Creative Conflict;but i don't know
Creative Conflict;but i'm
Creative Conflict;but lengthis
Creative Conflict;but then do you have to specifyoutput points?
Creative Conflict;but then this
Creative Conflict;but we may need to trackÇ-we may need toset up outputs you know
Creative Conflict;but what would the outputs necessarily be of that
Creative Conflict;but, i think
Creative Conflict;butthen there's
Creative Conflict;butthis can be dictated
Creative Conflict;do the roads delegate this, or do the intersections delegate all thecommunication
Creative Conflict;does it run on a clock or does
Creative Conflict;i don't [inaudible] into it.
Creative Conflict;i don't think we need to make assumption of lanes, period
Creative Conflict;if it blocks, the queue tells it hey i'mfull, that thread has to stop you know and then it's got to pull it tomake it go again
Creative Conflict;if some carhere is wanting to go straight and this is backed up, they cannot
Creative Conflict;if the queue is empty on the road, don't trigger it green
Creative Conflict;if theres a one way road, so basically there's only one endpoint on this road
Creative Conflict;if theres no traffic
Creative Conflict;if there's no traffic, neverturn it green.
Creative Conflict;if this road fills up, it's going to have to know i'm full, i can'taccept anymore traffic coming down my way.
Creative Conflict;if we just say has the car,and then the rules come in here whether it's sensored or nonsensored.
Creative Conflict;if we make the assumption that we're not going to have so a twolaneroad that turns into a oneÇ-lane road, i think we're fineÇ-
Creative Conflict;if we think about, you know,somebody is going to say start feeding cars in here, and then thisguy has to say hey i'm full, stop
Creative Conflict;if you have one lane, you don't really run intoreality
Creative Conflict;if you're going to get back up here youcould potentially back it up into the next intersection dependingon this length here which is going to
Creative Conflict;if you'renot, if you don't want a sensor, they said they can have withoutsensors, then it's completely time based.
Creative Conflict;if youthink of this as kind of an encapsulated entity then it's not goingto know about this.
Creative Conflict;ifyou have a full lane everywhere in the intersection so everythingfits they're two lanes at that point.
Creative Conflict;i'm not sure
Creative Conflict;i'm still wondering about the leftÇ-turn lane.
Creative Conflict;is it a push or a pull model with the intersections
Creative Conflict;it think so. yeah, i Creative Conflict.
Creative Conflict;it's getting down to push or pull
Creative Conflict;it's just a green but
Creative Conflict;mean if you think of, you know desktop or
Creative Conflict;one signal perdirection at each intersection. could be
Creative Conflict;or do we just assume that anything doesn'thaveÇ-
Creative Conflict;or intersection is going tohave to say something. okay, cars can come, and then the roadsare going to have to
Creative Conflict;or is thatÇ-
Creative Conflict;or is this thetime between state changes
Creative Conflict;or, i'mgoing to have a left
Creative Conflict;other option is to make it a full two second lane
Creative Conflict;put them in, or pull them out
Creative Conflict;sense to me or just basically
Creative Conflict;so a lane has a signal, you know just kind of abstract.
Creative Conflict;so basically each entry into the intersection there's going to be nnumber of signals
Creative Conflict;so basically intersection is going to say to this road, you know r1,r2, r3, r4
Creative Conflict;so basically leftor straight depending on the car.
Creative Conflict;so basically there would be a queue
Creative Conflict;so basically we need an option to say
Creative Conflict;so each road is going
Creative Conflict;so how are these signals
Creative Conflict;so howÇ-what is the behavior of the inputs andwould there be any requirements on that?
Creative Conflict;so i have a leftÇ-turn lane
Creative Conflict;so i mean at that
Creative Conflict;so i think
Creative Conflict;so i think one of the things we'recoming out is the roadÇ-i don't know if it has lanes so much as ithas, you know left, straight, right
Creative Conflict;so i think we
Creative Conflict;so i would
Creative Conflict;so if an intersection has a sensor, thenÇ-i think is that assimple as this intersection having api with the road calls?
Creative Conflict;so if we
Creative Conflict;so in terms of software
Creative Conflict;so it depends
Creative Conflict;so it seems like they're designing
Creative Conflict;so it sounds like the intersection needs to basically grab from thisroad to whatever connected road it needs to go.
Creative Conflict;so let's get into that.
Creative Conflict;so let's go with the minimum so
Creative Conflict;so our intersectionsÇ-so it seems like our real thing isÇ-now
Creative Conflict;so roads is the means by traffic gets to each individualintersection so we have to have a connection ofÇ-the intersectionhave to be connected in some way. so that the roads would beour connection points
Creative Conflict;so that if
Creative Conflict;so that way the road
Creative Conflict;so that's another
Creative Conflict;so the big rocks we're putting in the jar are
Creative Conflict;so there's
Creative Conflict;so there's this protected left
Creative Conflict;so there's this, this relationship here. each road connects to twointersections
Creative Conflict;so this is really all the editing someone's
Creative Conflict;so this road ends into one of its endpoints is an intersection
Creative Conflict;so this, i think, is the model on which to build the end userapplication.
Creative Conflict;so timing
Creative Conflict;so to keep it moving
Creative Conflict;so we definitely have
Creative Conflict;so we have a model
Creative Conflict;so we have this behavior
Creative Conflict;so we kind
Creative Conflict;so we want simple
Creative Conflict;so we've got kind of this,
Creative Conflict;so what are the aspects of the speed that are important?
Creative Conflict;so which ones do
Creative Conflict;so you
Creative Conflict;so you just haverotating green, yellow, red
Creative Conflict;so you've got an input
Creative Conflict;so, we need aprotected left
Creative Conflict;so. we can think
Creative Conflict;this has a length, it never overflows, you know iften, five cars can fit then it's all
Creative Conflict;yeah, because it could you know
Creative Conflict;you follow thepercentage model then we can just calculate what that wouldmean for the entry source of cars coming in.
Creative Conflict;you know, or input
Creative Conflict;but i mean having a selection is probably makes it
Creative Conflict;but is that?
Creative Conflict;i Creative Conflict on that
Creative Conflict;i donít see this specifically in the requirements
Creative Conflict;i mean it could be one or two i guess
Creative Conflict;i thought it would be different, but i guess this would also be fine
Creative Conflict;itís not stated there, but we think it would be useful
Creative Conflict;so i guess density is not enough
Creative Conflict;Ö i donít understand
Creative Conflict;ah okay, you say this is some kind of, yeah, but this could be possible in both cases
Creative Conflict;and then we had the road endpoint which could either be a real endpoint or it could be an intersection
Creative Conflict;and this i guess is easier than doing the same logic and afterwards subdividing the roads always
Creative Conflict;and through the road endpoint it has one, two, four, Ö is possible, fourteen is not good
Creative Conflict;and we either have a real intersection or we have an end point
Creative Conflict;but also for calculating statistics
Creative Conflict;but first maybe we can discuss how to, whatís the best way to define the problem in itself
Creative Conflict;but i assume roads will also be a form of association
Creative Conflict;but i donít know
Creative Conflict;but i would assume
Creative Conflict;but if you say map is our starting point and everything is connected to this by association or something like that would be fine for me.
Creative Conflict;but itís just the surrounding
Creative Conflict;but maybe first
Creative Conflict;but the overall implementation should be able to work with more roads or less.
Creative Conflict;but then again how would you declare
Creative Conflict;but we want to say if we make a throughput through the system via endpoints we would have traffic on endpoints
Creative Conflict;but why do i want to move the intersection?
Creative Conflict;but why donít we have a traffic model per se?
Creative Conflict;but would traffic class in that case, does it make sense to have the relation to the road itself
Creative Conflict;do we really have an actual intersection as an item or is it just indirectly given if you do an intersection?
Creative Conflict;do we want to make it easy and just have density as part of the road or do we want to make something more sophisticated in terms of traffic models.
Creative Conflict;donít know per what
Creative Conflict;for me it maybe doesnít make sense to have this as a specific intersection, maybe there we would have something different which is a kind of road entry or road exit
Creative Conflict;i asked if that is what you wanted, but it sounds like it was not
Creative Conflict;i donít know how much details we have
Creative Conflict;i donít know how to call it but we can also use it to influence the traffic from outside, which could be something specific
Creative Conflict;i donít know.
Creative Conflict;i mean another alternative would be to just have something like a default timing which you can change
Creative Conflict;i mean if we view a road that is the whole thing, the whole map, i mean it could have multiple intersections,
Creative Conflict;i would say both is good. i think default timing should also be available or which is always given and then you can define which default timing can be used.
Creative Conflict;iím just thinking not only from a visualization perspective but also from a simulation perspective
Creative Conflict;iím not so sure about that
Creative Conflict;iím not sure
Creative Conflict;iím not sure what you mean by subset
Creative Conflict;if later on we have something not just four way but with this t-crossing, then we should easily be able to support this
Creative Conflict;if the map is changing in a way that you add another intersection in between the appearances of roads are recalculated, but this then is a letís say more complex part and you need to copy the attributes and so on so it shouldnít be so difficult
Creative Conflict;if the system is working, then additional things will be requested and itís better to have it already separated instead of putting all in one class
Creative Conflict;if the traffic model should be completely separate entity here, which relates to the map or if we should just make it easier just make the roads have a simple density.
Creative Conflict;if we are going for a more model-view-controller pattern or something like that maybe we want to separate the visualization in some sense
Creative Conflict;if we want to make it more advanced in the future like you said with the more detailed definition of traffic for which kind of cars and so on we already have the right entry
Creative Conflict;if we want to take the five we can make it even easier and say that roads have a single attribute saying density or something like that
Creative Conflict;if you follow the assignment i mean there is specifically mentioned traffic density for the roads, but then it wonít be as easy to calculate something like system throughput or anything like that so it could also be hard to simulate letís say the time it takes for a single car from point a to point b
Creative Conflict;if you move the intersection the road will become longer so i guess the velocity will have a different impact on the total throughput.
Creative Conflict;if you want to evaluate traffic, evaluate the performance of the traffic lights as a system itself
Creative Conflict;it could be open ended, it could be, i guess anything. a house or something
Creative Conflict;itís not specifically defined but the purpose
Creative Conflict;letís say you are in editor mode in the map and you want to move an intersection or something like that. then moving that intersection would be very complicated, because you would have to take into account how the roads were drawn initially and so on.
Creative Conflict;maybe i miss something right now but these are for my feelings the things we could represent in the class model.
Creative Conflict;mean if you only have one visual element then there is no point for it
Creative Conflict;of course we can represent this here but we should also keep in mind that this could be changed in the future and that we should design the system that is able to change this.
Creative Conflict;so four
Creative Conflict;so if it comes to density i would add the traffic item not just having a description on the road, because i guess in which direction you are going, you want to have it more advanced and if we are starting the system these kinds of requirements will come
Creative Conflict;so if we donít have any traffic model per se we are only talking about how much density there is on a single road
Creative Conflict;so if we take this example and you just want to move this intersection over here instead. you have a road going out there, and another one going there, and another one going there.
Creative Conflict;so itís clear that there could be not any more than four way intersections
Creative Conflict;so itís stated that it is related to the intersection, not to the road.
Creative Conflict;so then if i add a third road, then i would have this
Creative Conflict;so then you could follow an individual car how it goes through the map and then the simulation of every car that would be the traffic model with a density for a single road and so on.
Creative Conflict;so traffic light behavior can be defined
Creative Conflict;so we have to choose, one of them has to be open ended so to speak.
Creative Conflict;so you have the road endpoint, okay, and therefore we have, what was it? the road has two endpoints
Creative Conflict;t could be either a real endpoint or an intersection
Creative Conflict;this makes the calculation more complicated, but on the other hand itís something like if we donít want to design or define traffic per road which is one of the tasks or requirements.
Creative Conflict;traffic is not visualized really, and we could also have a visualization of the traffic, could make sense
Creative Conflict;we donít have i mean the visualization for it and iím not sure how we should.
Creative Conflict;we should have both
Creative Conflict;yes, either a road or intersection. you can see the details.
Creative Conflict;you are right, based on the current things it doesnít make too much sense that you have this reuse of traffic
Creative Conflict;but of course also
Creative Conflict;if it was green before, we have to change
Creative Conflict;if we select
Creative Conflict;if we, first time when you draw something and then try to play
Creative Conflict;meant that if we want to detect it automatically we have to say
Creative Conflict;, i am not sure
Creative Conflict;ah, ok because that was something i was just wondering about, whether we should
Creative Conflict;am still not sure how to
Creative Conflict;and of course the, that i guess, that itís not something that we have to design
Creative Conflict;and so, or sequences or more than one traffic
Creative Conflict;anyway, but that the
Creative Conflict;because otherwise the other cars just need to wait until no more cars actually crossing the traffic light and we need to take this into account.
Creative Conflict;because otherwise this might result in a crash
Creative Conflict;because then this might result in an accident
Creative Conflict;but does the user need to be able to define in our simplified version?
Creative Conflict;but how should that work
Creative Conflict;but i am not sure, where
Creative Conflict;but i donít know how to easily program that kind of behavior
Creative Conflict;but i donít think it is necessary, but i mean that depends
Creative Conflict;but i don't know that's also
Creative Conflict;but i mean a very easy way, oh but then you have to rename them
Creative Conflict;but i think it might not be very handsome for meaning for the
Creative Conflict;but if
Creative Conflict;but of course would increase the complexity of the
Creative Conflict;but rather focus
Creative Conflict;but that they reference each other in some way.
Creative Conflict;but thatís what i meant with my circles
Creative Conflict;but then
Creative Conflict;but then i mean
Creative Conflict;but then i was thinking about how to describe the sequence and
Creative Conflict;but we probably also need to take some delay into account
Creative Conflict;can both of them be orange at the same time for example?
Creative Conflict;exactly
Creative Conflict;i am not sure
Creative Conflict;i am not sure how to deal with the wave her.
Creative Conflict;i didnít take it into account that it says that enters the map on a given road, so but then itís probably better to do like this at the start of the road or at the end of the road,
Creative Conflict;i donít know
Creative Conflict;i donít know how to design it
Creative Conflict;i donít know,
Creative Conflict;i donít think so,
Creative Conflict;i mean the easiest way is to just have as you said, timings
Creative Conflict;i think so because you should be able to have, you should be able to have intersections with no sensors then the intersections lights should be able to change based on the input from these sensors, so then
Creative Conflict;i was just thinking about the other possibility, whether we should design it like this: in an intersection
Creative Conflict;if the user has to use the intersection symbol then we could definitely do it like this
Creative Conflict;if we have multiple intersections and then of course
Creative Conflict;if you assign like some kind of ids or whatsoever to the traffic light then perhaps one traffic light could reference another traffic light and the theoretically.
Creative Conflict;if you draw road here it should, you should be
Creative Conflict;if you know it then you can take it into account
Creative Conflict;if you set, if you set the one with the arrow, if you set that one to being green 30 seconds then you know that that one the other one is up and down right
Creative Conflict;if you will start simulation
Creative Conflict;itís a simple solution but we could do it some way different like this but then we would probably need some kind of main, i donít know, main traffic light or reference point for the traffic lights so that we know, when will which one start and which one, so i mean
Creative Conflict;mean if we consider our example, i mean in some way, letís just
Creative Conflict;no, i donít know, that doesnít matter.
Creative Conflict;o maybe i mean, thatís the thing, you just have to draw a road, because all of them should have traffic lights
Creative Conflict;ok, yeah
Creative Conflict;or do we need this for every intersection?
Creative Conflict;or down to up
Creative Conflict;or one
Creative Conflict;or other shorts what you defined with the circle, letís just say for the safe of complicity, itís like this, so then this one would be green in the beginning and by no car would be in this area, no car would be here, thatís, here we have these two nice cars
Creative Conflict;or should you be able to set like, this is car spawn, the car spawn, which spawns cars and this is like a sync where cars disappear.
Creative Conflict;perhaps this is not a very good idea to draw in this direction
Creative Conflict;perhaps we simplify draw intersections for lazy students
Creative Conflict;so basically
Creative Conflict;so create a crash if this car would drive here
Creative Conflict;so either they should be able to use go like 20 seconds red, blablabla blablabla or depending on this senso
Creative Conflict;so i donít know
Creative Conflict;so i mean
Creative Conflict;so if you can set how long the one that you draw an arrow to if she said this one to 20 seconds green and maybe orange or yellow,
Creative Conflict;so that is i mean the easiest i guess
Creative Conflict;so then you have an intersection
Creative Conflict;so there is no undo
Creative Conflict;so we can see what we
Creative Conflict;so we have
Creative Conflict;thatís right, i Creative Conflict, so we should
Creative Conflict;the question is whether we, should they put the sensors wide away or whether we should do try to find a means brake without the sensors and see whether itís a, what we achieve there
Creative Conflict;use the road symbol and also draw intersections like this then of course we would need to allow him to draw traffic light symbols in addition to that
Creative Conflict;whether you should be able to position this car spawning symbol at the beginning or whether it should be just able to detect this is the beginning of the road
Creative Conflict;which would of course require us to be able to, i donít know, either
Creative Conflict;yeah i mean it would be interesting because then you can create more complex pattern and so, or sequences or more than one traffic light.
Creative Conflict;yeah so then we should be able to connect them somehow.
Creative Conflict;yeah, exactly
Creative Conflict;yeah, exactly, thatís what i mean,
Creative Conflict;yeah, for me it doesnít matter
Creative Conflict;yeah, i am not sure,
Creative Conflict;yeah, of course we could also do it like this
Creative Conflict;yeah, yeah
Creative Conflict;you have to switch to green or to orange or red
Active Discussion;i donít see anything.
Active Discussion;does that saygreen, red, and left?
Active Discussion;does the network also split up the roads
Active Discussion;how do icreate an intersection
Active Discussion;is itthe same thing?
Active Discussion;where does that say off ramp?
Active Discussion;would that be a property of the queue or a property of thecar?
Active Discussion;you mean the actual data structures?
Active Discussion;and what does that mean?
Active Discussion;but what constitutes a well?movingtraffic
Active Discussion;but what does the intersection, what is the purpose of theintersection in life
Active Discussion;right
Active Discussion;how do you coordinate that between all signals at eachintersection?
Active Discussion;is it a push or a pull model with the intersections
Active Discussion;so howÇ-what is the behavior of the inputs andwould there be any requirements on that?
Active Discussion;that's where i always liketo start. how do you see the code beingÇ-just kind of thestructure of it being broken down?
Active Discussion;the only thing i'm kind of botheredis how do weÇ-how does this guy come into play in all of this?
Active Discussion;would it add a car?
Active Discussion;ah road density or traffic density?
Active Discussion;by moving the intersection you mean also changing the geometrical appearance of the roads?
Active Discussion;do you just want to be able to design the traffic for one of the parts?
Active Discussion;do you want to only be able to design the overall thing, which then would be an issue regarding the traffic
Active Discussion;is a road always that ending at an intersection or is a road like the designer when he starts to design the map, like i did right now?
Active Discussion;is it the traffic of the whole system or the traffic of a single road
Active Discussion;so whatís the difference between the visual map and the rad layout
Active Discussion;so you just mean the attributes regarding sensor and the assigned traffic lights and traffic behavior?
Active Discussion;what do you mean bigger level?
Active Discussion;what do you mean by moving the intersection?
Active Discussion;what do you want to say?
Active Discussion;what is the traffic class actually representing
Active Discussion;what were you thinking?
Active Discussion;why what? the part i donít get is why we donít have traffic density.
Active Discussion;yes, i mean my main point is what would be part of that view?
Active Discussion;you mean attributes describing the geometrical positioning of everything?
Active Discussion;do they have to?
Active Discussion;in the four?
Active Discussion;is there a certain reason for you drawing this options of like roads or traffic signs to the right hand side of the window?
Active Discussion;is this how they set, did you mean, by adding car symbols?
Active Discussion;what do you mean?
Active Discussion;which other one
Active Discussion;yeah, which one starts, yeah exactly, which one is triggered first, thatís what you mean?
Active Discussion;yeah, you mean that we somehow connect them?
Active Discussion;you mean the signals of the same intersection
Active Discussion;you wouldnít provide some kind of element to draw intersections immediately but rather focus on drawing streets and then for like crossing streets we then have intersections that should be detected automatically?
Creative Conflict;actually i [inaudible] should either.
Creative Conflict;ah okay, you say this is some kind of, yeah, but this could be possible in both cases
Creative Conflict;i would say both is good. i think default timing should also be available or which is always given and then you can define which default timing can be used.
Creative Conflict;iím just thinking not only from a visualization perspective but also from a simulation perspective
Creative Conflict;we should have both
Creative Conflict;yes, either a road or intersection. you can see the details.
Creative Conflict;no, i donít know, that doesnít matter.
Creative Conflict;yeah, for me it doesnít matter
Conversation Management;okay so it says that's up to us
Conversation Management;and nowshould we try
Conversation Management;and then come up with progressively--start off with thesimplest user story, and then progressively add user stories3and then maybe have pictures to illustrate how in our systemthose user stories will be achieved
Conversation Management;at least we can go through it right now. a few tables
Conversation Management;fifteen minutes into documenting,talking about the engineering design, code structure
Conversation Management;i guess we should write some of these things down.
Conversation Management;i was thinking we could startwith what we have now and fall on a user story of runningthis simulation now.
Conversation Management;i'm sort of reminded of the fact that we're supposed to allowlights to have sets of rules
Conversation Management;i'm wondering with half an hour left if we need to thinkabout how to--
Conversation Management;let's sketch a ui
Conversation Management;maybe we can peg that for the moment and introducethat as we flush this out.
Conversation Management;maybe we should start talking about the u
Conversation Management;should we start soon?
Conversation Management;so basic--design a basic structure of code.so to me, that's where we've got the model. the model anda little bit of how controller controls the model.
Conversation Management;so should we talk about end [inaudible
Conversation Management;well let's stick to the grid
Conversation Management;well now, intersection class
Conversation Management;we'll tackle that when we get there
Conversation Management;well we can write that down
Conversation Management;where's the first place to start?
Conversation Management;yeah maybe let's start with thenetwork
Conversation Management;does the professor want the students to learn that through trialand error
Conversation Management;goal is that as many cars are moving at any given time asclose to speed limit as possible
Conversation Management;his is always the point where i'm scared toerase the board. we need to take a picture of that.
Conversation Management;it's kind of like i go back, like what is exactly theoutput, you kno
Conversation Management;letme erase over here. it's this stuff that i'm worried about. it'skind of sketchy.
Conversation Management;lets assume this, lets assume it's inside a city so...
Conversation Management;summarize the unclaritiesthat we had for professor e
Conversation Management;this is something where i'd go back to the customer and tryand figure out
Conversation Management;this is when i pull out my camera
Conversation Management;this is why we need to check with theprofessor again
Conversation Management;where are you drawing
Conversation Management;let's see what other data do we pull out
Conversation Management;call it a [inaudible] requirement. cool. let's check for anyother...
Conversation Management;concerned with too much detail before weevenÇ-otherwise we're going to cut stuff out.
Conversation Management;i think we haveÇ-we can probably numerate the rules we'regoing to need too.
Conversation Management;i want to start by hearing your summary of this
Conversation Management;let's dive into that a little bit.
Conversation Management;let's explore that
Conversation Management;let's put it in there and we'll capture that.
Conversation Management;let's take that oneout
Conversation Management;so let's hide that detail. [inaudible].
Conversation Management;start twoengineers on the model, one engineer on the ui. get the modelgoing ahead. cool.
Conversation Management;the next step i would do is to
Conversation Management;we should model that
Conversation Management;guess we are also finished regarding the time, i guess we can stop here.
Conversation Management;i guess we can just restart
Conversation Management;i mean best we have 20 minutes.
Conversation Management;it could be some kind of traffic connected but we can also just leave it for now
Conversation Management;maybe we can remove it afterwards for other discussions?
Conversation Management;say okay we do a different tree on the right side which is just the overall items and these could be specific items which are road.
Conversation Management;should we go lower again and restart from the beginning, i donít think itís too difficult.
Conversation Management;ah okay, we have some time left. thirty minutes, okay
Conversation Management;but i just mark it blue to say we think it would be useful and should we go in this direction but to make a clear difference to what was our initial purpose regarding the requirements
Conversation Management;but i would make a statement like, what is it, zoom out, view and the model ad in between there should be some kind of controller, i put it here.
Conversation Management;but it really relates to exactly how ambitious we are
Conversation Management;but this should be something we keep in mind saying thatÖ maybe i can write it here that this needs to be recalculated
Conversation Management;do we have other items we are currently missing?
Conversation Management;how longÖ should we do this to 10.30?
Conversation Management;how much time is left? 10.30?
Conversation Management;i can also do it in blue as it is not part of the requirements.
Conversation Management;i think, i mean from the mental point of view i mean we are more or less done even if we define the controller and some use cases itís more boiler plate type of things.
Conversation Management;i will draw traffic, traffic light and traffic light behavior in parallel
Conversation Management;i would say itís too much, we donít get this done in time.
Conversation Management;later on we could also have this for the purposes you have described that all the attributes of the car like length or speed could influence the traffic at all.
Conversation Management;maybe for now itís fine in that way.
Conversation Management;maybe thatís also something that we cannot design right now in time
Conversation Management;maybe we check again the requirements, just go maybe through what we have or if we have everything.
Conversation Management;not that i can think of, maybe we can read the requirements again.
Conversation Management;now we can move it.
Conversation Management;okay then maybe letís check again the requirements
Conversation Management;so itís currently maybe a question how much is really necessary
Conversation Management;so maybe we draw this and then we make a component diagram sketch on saying which items we would put together and thatís it
Conversation Management;so maybe you start to do something and then i will continue that
Conversation Management;suspect we are going to have a lot of use cases, not sure we have the time for that.
Conversation Management;then i will remove it again
Conversation Management;this is also why i would do this in blue meaning this could also be an additional information
Conversation Management;this is where iím thinking about kind of which view we should have on this,
Conversation Management;what is the next?
Conversation Management;what was the timing? how much time is left for the design phase? (asking andreas) who?
Conversation Management;yes i would say letís start easy and we can add additional things later on
Conversation Management;ah no, this is not working
Conversation Management;ah, ok, so i donít know why, at least we can both draw
Conversation Management;ah, yes, ok, itís fine, so once again i will also try to draw something, ok?
Conversation Management;and further we figure to, i mean we can delete it afterwards.
Conversation Management;but ok, should we leave the main window as it is. i have it as a paper in my hand
Conversation Management;first of should we both zoom out to the maximum so that we always see everything?
Conversation Management;i donít think so
Conversation Management;i think thatís everything to be said.
Conversation Management;i think this should be the only issue right now
Conversation Management;i thought i was drawing again, perhaps we need to activate the mouse again
Conversation Management;mean first we can assign numbers here to be able to talk about it.
Conversation Management;ok
Conversation Management;ok, finger works
Conversation Management;ok, perhaps, i need to read this bullet point c again to actual look what it says
Conversation Management;ok, so where did we stop?
Conversation Management;outside, oh yeah
Conversation Management;perhaps, there are just some basic question in the beginning
Conversation Management;so basically we could do first thing what was on the lefthand side, what i was trying to achieve here
Conversation Management;so some streets again, delete that later
Conversation Management;so thatís no, i think we didnít draw so much, so thatís no big deal
Conversation Management;so what should we start with?
Conversation Management;this is for demonstration purposes.
Conversation Management;we can start right again.
Conversation Management;we start all very again?
Conversation Management;well, the question is, if it is not working, you would need to do the drawing stuff.
Conversation Management;what should we try to get it working or?
Conversation Management;yeah
Conversation Management;yeah do you want to summarise?
Conversation Management;yeah i see
Conversation Management;yeah, i mean, perhaps you can just add something, if i forget something
Conversation Management;yeah, no problem.
Conversation Management;yeah?
Conversation Management;yes
Creative Conflict;what basic data structures are we looking at here?
Creative Conflict;actually start coding up the datastructures themselves
Creative Conflict;but i imagine the controller controls that, right, the modelbasically is just the basically cars, the queue of cars, theintersection contains four queues.
Creative Conflict;i'm thinking, yeah, i'm thinking in terms of model-êviewcontroller
Creative Conflict;mean it might be thedesign pattern. a traverser, observer, traverser
Creative Conflict;object being traversed and somerule for--so it's easy the traverser, visitor pattern you get thevisitor case on the auto-êtype and then it could be [inaudible
Creative Conflict;to separate the ui off andwe want the underlying data structures and supporting things
Creative Conflict;model-view-controller pattern
Creative Conflict;then we have the model, we have the view, but we donít have the controller
Creative Conflict;we have a statement that we do model view controller pattern
Creative Conflict;is part of the intersection
Creative Conflict;i don't [inaudible] into it.
Creative Conflict;i don't think we need to make assumption of lanes, period
Creative Conflict;i donít see this specifically in the requirements
Creative Conflict;for me it maybe doesnít make sense to have this as a specific intersection, maybe there we would have something different which is a kind of road entry or road exit
Creative Conflict;and of course the, that i guess, that itís not something that we have to design
Creative Conflict;but of course would increase the complexity of the
Creative Conflict;i donít think so,
Creative Conflict;i think so because you should be able to have, you should be able to have intersections with no sensors then the intersections lights should be able to change based on the input from these sensors, so then
Creative Conflict;no
Creative Conflict;i don't know
Creative Conflict;i don't know how to actually structure this
Creative Conflict;wonder if atfirst approximation never [inaudible] in roads.
Creative Conflict;and i wonder
Creative Conflict;i don't know if this isany better
Creative Conflict;i mean i'm wondering could youadd
Creative Conflict;i wonder if
Creative Conflict;i'm notquite sure
Creative Conflict;just wonder if maybe the important
Creative Conflict;well, i don't know
Creative Conflict;i almost wonder if, i don't know.
Creative Conflict;i don't know how sensors work.
Creative Conflict;i don't know if professor e really wants that level ofdetail
Creative Conflict;i don't know if they can set thespeeds
Creative Conflict;i don't know if you can changethese as well while you're going.
Creative Conflict;i don't know if. but youalready got this on there,
Creative Conflict;i don't know so much
Creative Conflict;i don't know,
Creative Conflict;i don't know.
Creative Conflict;i don't knowthat almost feels like
Creative Conflict;i don'tknow
Creative Conflict;i don'tknow exactly how to capture this
Creative Conflict;i'm not reallysure
Creative Conflict;i'm not sure.
Creative Conflict;i'm still thinking
Creative Conflict;now i don't know
Creative Conflict;oh that's not going to quite work.
Creative Conflict;or did i readsomething there that said it has some
Creative Conflict;this is where we still have a little doubt
Creative Conflict;, i'm not sure
Creative Conflict;but i don't know
Creative Conflict;i'm not sure
Creative Conflict;i'm still wondering about the leftÇ-turn lane.
Creative Conflict;Ö i donít understand
Creative Conflict;but i donít know
Creative Conflict;donít know per what
Creative Conflict;i donít know how much details we have
Creative Conflict;i donít know.
Creative Conflict;iím not so sure about that
Creative Conflict;iím not sure
Creative Conflict;iím not sure what you mean by subset
Creative Conflict;we donít have i mean the visualization for it and iím not sure how we should.
Creative Conflict;, i am not sure
Creative Conflict;ah, ok because that was something i was just wondering about, whether we should
Creative Conflict;am still not sure how to
Creative Conflict;but how should that work
Creative Conflict;but i am not sure, where
Creative Conflict;but i donít know how to easily program that kind of behavior
Creative Conflict;but i don't know that's also
Creative Conflict;can both of them be orange at the same time for example?
Creative Conflict;i am not sure
Active Discussion;i am not sure
Active Discussion;i am not sure how to deal with the wave her.
Active Discussion;i donít know
Active Discussion;i donít know how to design it
Active Discussion;i donít know,
Active Discussion;i donít know.
Active Discussion;perhaps this is not a very good idea to draw in this direction
Active Discussion;so i donít know
Active Discussion;the question is whether we, should they put the sensors wide away or whether we should do try to find a means brake without the sensors and see whether itís a, what we achieve there
Active Discussion;which would of course require us to be able to, i donít know, either
Active Discussion;yeah, i am not sure,
Active Discussion;a bit more usable so i Creative Conflict
Active Discussion;advanced in the future
Active Discussion;and then the point could be i guess for future could define anything
Active Discussion;it would also be always given indirectly. it takes less work for the editing, you can easily just draw the lines and each time you would have here endpoints an intersections which are all calculated automatically and then by selecting an intersection you could describe the movement of an intersection, which is a more advanced algorithm to relayout the whole thing.
Active Discussion;of course we can represent this here but we should also keep in mind that this could be changed in the future and that we should design the system that is able to change this.
Active Discussion;so i see a reuse potential there
Active Discussion;yes i would keep the traffic class also for reuse purposes
Active Discussion;advanced in the future
Active Discussion;and then the point could be i guess for future could define anything
Active Discussion;it would also be always given indirectly. it takes less work for the editing, you can easily just draw the lines and each time you would have here endpoints an intersections which are all calculated automatically and then by selecting an intersection you could describe the movement of an intersection, which is a more advanced algorithm to relayout the whole thing.
Active Discussion;of course we can represent this here but we should also keep in mind that this could be changed in the future and that we should design the system that is able to change this.
Active Discussion;so i see a reuse potential there
Active Discussion;yes i would keep the traffic class also for reuse purposes
Active Discussion;and the results of pushing and popping.
Active Discussion;and then some t, at some point t one later.
Active Discussion;i mean you could go top left
Active Discussion;so the cop looks at the intersections says okay it's Creative Conflictn light on these roads. this road has some number ofcars in it. if the lights green one tick means we pop and wedo that queue and second picture. so, from t zero to t onethat's how we've gone through two
Active Discussion;that kicks off events and then which then make a [inaudible
Active Discussion;that kicks off events.
Active Discussion;the other way
Active Discussion;this guywould have the sensor state,
Active Discussion;unless you're the terminator and you've beamed acar.
Active Discussion;until he passes the intersection, or whatever. and gets onthe next road
Active Discussion;we're saying there's a, so then, these are objects right.so, maybe what happens is the clock is the controller, it'schanging the state of time so time can tick, right, that's anamount of time. the clock does the ticking, right, and nowthe tick, time is part of model that is state, but as timechanges some cop object or something responds to timechanges, right, and is responsible for changing state ofmodel.
Active Discussion;also
Active Discussion;also, i mean it seems
Active Discussion;and it just tell them, hey full or heyi don't have any. so it's not it's own little thinking component.
Active Discussion;and then test it, are you full?
Active Discussion;aslong asÇ-also being able to control
Active Discussion;imean it comes back to this whole problem that we were toyingwith.
Active Discussion;what did i say? ìroad endpointsî, four and one. then we would have ìroadî
Active Discussion;also we have it on the laptop screen
Active Discussion;also before we draw again so first i can right now try to save the image
Active Discussion;are they controlling
Active Discussion;so they can build on?
Active Discussion;something?
Active Discussion;, this would be visible
Active Discussion;i mean how do you visualize this simulation
Active Discussion;what does that mean?
Active Discussion;what else are we going to be drawing?
Active Discussion;so in total?
Active Discussion;the sensors?
Active Discussion;what about it?
Active Discussion;do you have a better statement?
Active Discussion;i mean what are the types of metrics that we want to have in percent?
Active Discussion;well i like what you're saying, i like the idea
Active Discussion;when jim is present, only jim does the board, as you see hishand?writing, his ability to use markers is remarkable, so noone approaches the board, he's very good.
Active Discussion;ahh that's brilliant
Active Discussion;cool, cool. sounds good
Active Discussion;cool, i like that
Active Discussion;excellent, excellent.
Active Discussion;good question.
Active Discussion;i like that. cool.
Active Discussion;interesting
Active Discussion;that is a great point
Active Discussion;i think itís a good and great idea
Active Discussion;thatís a good point
Active Discussion;yes i Creative Conflict. great
Active Discussion;yes thatís a good idea.
Active Discussion;yes, i think itís a good idea
Active Discussion;as capacity increases, the wait time doesn't increaseproportionally
Active Discussion;it'sreally just a list of road, road pairs i guess, and thenintersections
Active Discussion;then this way wecan, it's really the network that runs the road,
Active Discussion;what i'm thinking is like you have this data structure of thistraffic cop that responds to ticks by analyzing the state of thetraffic signal and then, you know, pushes cars on and offqueue depending on the -ê
Active Discussion;the traffic pattern object, the big guy, owns all the cars,and as it manufactures them, as it factors them out, it createsthem in some flavor,
Active Discussion;and by default it eitherhas or does not have a timing setting, so very quickly you cancreate something without fussing with it too much, and bydefault it has to assume
Active Discussion;but i'm saying that you would say that 10% of cars willbehave like this, 10% will go straight, 10% will go tointersections and turn
Active Discussion;how do you assess, you know, what is the optimalósothis is the grid, what is the optimal setting of the intersectionconfigurations with this traffic pattern.
Active Discussion;how far is it between each leg orwhatever, each segment.
Active Discussion;so we assume they have some sort of a pallet here where theygrab a road and they start dragging and then they drag that, sothere is some sort of drawing pallet right, that says okay i havethis thing i drag something, i'm drawing a road and i call itsomething and i draw and i call it b and i draw my roads andthen.
Active Discussion;that, and it also pushesit up to the road, so the road can aggregate, create the reportslater for all the intersections it has so we can aggregate thesething, so you can aggregate so you can get individualinformation on each car, on each intersection, on each road
Active Discussion;the intersection knows how many cars it has, and fullinventory of each car's direction, status, waiting, and waitingfor what.
Active Discussion;this is an approach
Active Discussion;i mean, the roads have a length
Active Discussion;i mean with that they havetwo intersections coming to four turn lanes, i mean that's theproblem
Active Discussion;i'mtrying to figure out how to capture the state of a car going down aspecific road
Active Discussion;kind of the situation of how they are physically doesn't matter,we just more care about what's leading up to it, and what it'sleading off to.
Active Discussion;that's the real scenario
Active Discussion;what i'm wondering is that, is it one of thoseÇ-
Active Discussion;. you would have some kind of patterns for traffic lights, different ones which you will use on different intersections
Active Discussion;at least a starting point and end point
Active Discussion;for me itís the traffic on a single road
Creative Conflict;you should be able to say how many cars per or something it should create
Creative Conflict;you wouldnít provide some kind of element to draw intersections immediately but rather focus on drawing streets and then for like crossing streets we then have intersections that should be detected automatically?
Creative Conflict;and ithas a queue, which of course has push [inaudible]. okay.
Creative Conflict;it has sensors and, it has the timing, current state, no it hasticks in current state
Creative Conflict;n = new network,, c = new clock. andthen we go c.run(n).
Creative Conflict;so maybe this is public and this is private in the sensethat you only ever have roads in the network when it's at theintersections because i don't think, i'm trying to
Creative Conflict;permutations that happen at eachintersection
Creative Conflict;reallywhen you're filling out stuff about an intersection, you're fillingout information about each of the approaches
Creative Conflict;this in html.reporting
Creative Conflict;, i was kind of assuming simple db here.
Creative Conflict;would need to be persistable.
Creative Conflict;and not the primitive type that was essentially
Creative Conflict;but the overall implementation should be able to work with more roads or less.
Creative Conflict;for now we donít have any attributes for the endpoint
Creative Conflict;in there, there is a boolean attribute indicating the sensors are available.
Creative Conflict;is it an attribute for the road?
Creative Conflict;so letís add an interface then
Creative Conflict;so we do some kind of extra class or interface for intersection
Creative Conflict;the name for the interface
Creative Conflict;okay so it says that's up to us
Creative Conflict;so dowe want to have visualization of cars moving along aparticular road in a geometric sense?
Creative Conflict;so now the push is not just the random numbergenerator for frequency, but there's also random numbergenerator for zero one for left versus right
Creative Conflict;. so add road could potentially have, what's theplace you could ever, you did this.
Creative Conflict;but should readily accommodate six intersections--okayso we can actually accommodate [inaudible] larger
Creative Conflict;create a road there's no intersection, so road existsoutside of the intersection
Creative Conflict;it would have multiple lanes so thatin a sense it has multiple queues
Creative Conflict;like so that you've got this intersection next to thisintersection and if this road fills up, then even
Creative Conflict;right so this is now a ui piece and the dot, brings up youreditor with frequency of, your frequency value
Creative Conflict;so
Creative Conflict;so all these lines of
Creative Conflict;so clock is a controller
Creative Conflict;so do you want
Creative Conflict;so for every tick, the analytics guy does asweep, collecting statistical data about the state of each tick
Creative Conflict;so foreach road in the simulation we look at the car at the head ofthe queue
Creative Conflict;so get rid of this
Creative Conflict;so highlight
Creative Conflict;so i
Creative Conflict;so i can see traffic flow across it.
Creative Conflict;so i think that might bethe best way to communicate interaction design.
Creative Conflict;so i think that's
Creative Conflict;so i was thinking
Creative Conflict;so if the
Creative Conflict;so i'll use a soliddot to mean ownership and then an open dot to meanreferencing. so the network owns the roads, the networkowns the intersections but the intersection can referencethese in and out roads. alright, so i guess we need, addroad
Creative Conflict;so i'm thinking maybe
Creative Conflict;so instead of just a straight
Creative Conflict;so is there someone looking at the networksaying the average congestion is, or the average wait time ofa car is,
Creative Conflict;so it might be thatthe road has some number of, an ordered list of cars that aremoving along the road and only when they get to the end ofthe road do they get pushed into the queue.
Creative Conflict;so it should
Creative Conflict;so it's a visit
Creative Conflict;so it's got to be just a grid likethat. that's fine.
Creative Conflict;so it's like8you're inferring intersection at crossings.
Creative Conflict;so it's saying at each tick we see where the problems occurand maybe make a road blink red if it's full and
Creative Conflict;so i've got two car lengths
Creative Conflict;so let's
Creative Conflict;so max cars, holds n.1
Creative Conflict;so maybe
Creative Conflict;so maybe it'sreally a function of the result of how the intersections arelaid out. and the relationship between the intersection. 8
Creative Conflict;so maybe we
Creative Conflict;so mostly straight and sometimes
Creative Conflict;so next userstory
Creative Conflict;so that comes back toanalytics right?
Creative Conflict;so that kind of comes into car
Creative Conflict;so that thisintersection is connected to this one, or is that
Creative Conflict;so that would
Creative Conflict;so that you
Creative Conflict;so that's just the function or the property on thelight
Creative Conflict;so that's one thing, and also like how longthese signals stay green
Creative Conflict;so that's the basic way to kick it all off i guess
Creative Conflict;so the cop as,
Creative Conflict;so the empty network is what we started outwith a blank page, as they drag a road on, that instantiates aroad object
Creative Conflict;so the only other way youcan get through
Creative Conflict;so the pop
Creative Conflict;so the random number
Creative Conflict;so then you drag
Creative Conflict;so therandom
Creative Conflict;so there needs to be some logic about, wellthat's interesting so there's a notion of the road in, road out.
Creative Conflict;so there's through here, off ramp and onramp right
Creative Conflict;so this is interesting, so now should allow for roads of anylength to be placed
Creative Conflict;so this network or graph hasadditional constraints.
Creative Conflict;so this one piece of state we haven't captured is whether aroad is an interior or we should call it an onramp
Creative Conflict;so this whole thing we should talk about road, got this modelcontrol or
Creative Conflict;so we
Creative Conflict;so we almost don't need a--well, we need car to havesomething in the queue
Creative Conflict;so we could come
Creative Conflict;so we makeroads, right. so one m of intersections and we would haveroad connected to the intersection or the intersection has2paths
Creative Conflict;so we need to communicate the interaction
Creative Conflict;so we want to, you know, does thishappen basically.
Creative Conflict;so wecould introduce a notion of speed into our queue
Creative Conflict;so we're
Creative Conflict;so we're getting some credit collection of rules here
Creative Conflict;so we've created a basic [inaudible] for it to run in.
Creative Conflict;so we've got a great
Creative Conflict;so when it comes
Creative Conflict;so where you
Creative Conflict;so you can't
Creative Conflict;so you click an
Creative Conflict;so you have a consistent road network.
Creative Conflict;so you have to explain
Creative Conflict;so you want the
Creative Conflict;so youcould simplify
Creative Conflict;so you're
Creative Conflict;so you're just doing it
Creative Conflict;so, go ahead
Creative Conflict;so, something happens as an external controller is ticking themodel
Creative Conflict;sodoes it have a sensor, yes, no
Creative Conflict;sothat we
Creative Conflict;sothis can be bigger than the window so scrolling, stuff likethat
Creative Conflict;then this guy would have a state. it's like okay i'vebeen in this state for two ticks, go to three don't change, goto four change, something like that. right, so this guy has anotion of the state of the light but also time and currentstate, right. so, the clock ticks, the cop says look at whatlights are green, one tick means one car goes through so wepop off the end of the queue, we say the cop notices the endof the intersection has been in this state for one tick so nochange needs to be made. and then we get the same greenstate
Creative Conflict;we're prettyconstrained in what we draw geometrically so it almostseems like it might be nice to [inaudible] the geometry fromthe simulation
Creative Conflict;so once the car exists
Creative Conflict;it'd have to be in 60 because you'd only get [inaudible] onthe green, [inaudible] on the red
Creative Conflict;know there is an overlap when both of them are red,because people run yellow lights, and they run red lights at theend so you'd get a collision
Creative Conflict;meaninglittle dots are moving, showing you how the traffic is flowing
Creative Conflict;o
Creative Conflict;okay, so that's another thing we want to be able to specify indrawing.
Creative Conflict;so i think it'sa little confusing.
Creative Conflict;so it would be 50 seconds
Creative Conflict;so it's almost lik
Creative Conflict;so it's like a drawing tool that can allow them to lay downthese intersections
Creative Conflict;so one thing is
Creative Conflict;so the
Creative Conflict;so the intersection
Creative Conflict;so the traffic pattern
Creative Conflict;so then it's divided pretty much between green and...
Creative Conflict;so then this would be intersection b2.
Creative Conflict;so there is a finite number
Creative Conflict;so this can get fairly complex very fast because you have allthese intersections
Creative Conflict;so we don't need to really place traffic lights,
Creative Conflict;so you couldn't
Creative Conflict;so you're going to have
Creative Conflict;there's kind of a drawing area here
Creative Conflict;well, so one little thing besides laying out the roads. weneed some kind of visualization of the map
Creative Conflict;so this is the left turnlane
Creative Conflict;. and so you find this flow which islike,
Creative Conflict;actually it doesn't require them to save it actually.so theoretically it's all good memory.
Creative Conflict;and so can you hit
Creative Conflict;and so instead of going from intersection
Creative Conflict;and so this guy has this loop, this do sim loop,and these are kind of the drivers of the system
Creative Conflict;and so we think about, termination of, do we get flow out of thissystem, do we think about
Creative Conflict;basically this needs tomodel a set of use cases.
Creative Conflict;so a lane has a signal, you know just kind of abstract.
Creative Conflict;so basically each entry into the intersection there's going to be nnumber of signals
Creative Conflict;so basically intersection is going to say to this road, you know r1,r2, r3, r4
Creative Conflict;so basically there would be a queue
Creative Conflict;so basically we need an option to say
Creative Conflict;so each road is going
Creative Conflict;so how are these signals
Creative Conflict;so howÇ-what is the behavior of the inputs andwould there be any requirements on that?
Creative Conflict;so i have a leftÇ-turn lane
Creative Conflict;so i mean at that
Creative Conflict;so i think
Creative Conflict;so i think one of the things we'recoming out is the roadÇ-i don't know if it has lanes so much as ithas, you know left, straight, right
Creative Conflict;so i think we
Creative Conflict;so i would
Creative Conflict;so if we
Creative Conflict;so in terms of software
Creative Conflict;so it depends
Creative Conflict;so it seems like they're designing
Creative Conflict;so it sounds like the intersection needs to basically grab from thisroad to whatever connected road it needs to go.
Creative Conflict;so let's get into that.
Creative Conflict;so let's go with the minimum so
Creative Conflict;so our intersectionsÇ-so it seems like our real thing isÇ-now
Creative Conflict;so roads is the means by traffic gets to each individualintersection so we have to have a connection ofÇ-the intersectionhave to be connected in some way. so that the roads would beour connection points
Creative Conflict;so that if
Creative Conflict;so that way the road
Creative Conflict;so that's another
Creative Conflict;so the big rocks we're putting in the jar are
Creative Conflict;so there's
Creative Conflict;so there's this protected left
Creative Conflict;so there's this, this relationship here. each road connects to twointersections
Creative Conflict;so this is really all the editing someone's
Creative Conflict;so this road ends into one of its endpoints is an intersection
Creative Conflict;so this, i think, is the model on which to build the end userapplication.
Creative Conflict;so timing
Creative Conflict;so to keep it moving
Creative Conflict;so we definitely have
Creative Conflict;so we have a model
Creative Conflict;so we have this behavior
Creative Conflict;so we kind
Creative Conflict;so we want simple
Creative Conflict;so we've got kind of this,
Creative Conflict;so what are the aspects of the speed that are important?
Creative Conflict;so which ones do
Creative Conflict;so you
Creative Conflict;so you just haverotating green, yellow, red
Creative Conflict;so you've got an input
Creative Conflict;so, we need aprotected left
Creative Conflict;so. we can think
Creative Conflict;so i guess density is not enough
Creative Conflict;and this i guess is easier than doing the same logic and afterwards subdividing the roads always
Creative Conflict;letís say you are in editor mode in the map and you want to move an intersection or something like that. then moving that intersection would be very complicated, because you would have to take into account how the roads were drawn initially and so on.
Creative Conflict;so four
Creative Conflict;so if it comes to density i would add the traffic item not just having a description on the road, because i guess in which direction you are going, you want to have it more advanced and if we are starting the system these kinds of requirements will come
Creative Conflict;so if we take this example and you just want to move this intersection over here instead. you have a road going out there, and another one going there, and another one going there.
Creative Conflict;so itís clear that there could be not any more than four way intersections
Creative Conflict;so itís stated that it is related to the intersection, not to the road.
Creative Conflict;so then you could follow an individual car how it goes through the map and then the simulation of every car that would be the traffic model with a density for a single road and so on.
Active Discussion;so traffic light behavior can be defined
Active Discussion;so you have the road endpoint, okay, and therefore we have, what was it? the road has two endpoints
Active Discussion;so i guess density is not enough
Active Discussion;and this i guess is easier than doing the same logic and afterwards subdividing the roads always
Active Discussion;letís say you are in editor mode in the map and you want to move an intersection or something like that. then moving that intersection would be very complicated, because you would have to take into account how the roads were drawn initially and so on.
Active Discussion;so four
Active Discussion;so if it comes to density i would add the traffic item not just having a description on the road, because i guess in which direction you are going, you want to have it more advanced and if we are starting the system these kinds of requirements will come
Active Discussion;so if we take this example and you just want to move this intersection over here instead. you have a road going out there, and another one going there, and another one going there.
Active Discussion;so itís clear that there could be not any more than four way intersections
Active Discussion;so itís stated that it is related to the intersection, not to the road.
Active Discussion;so then you could follow an individual car how it goes through the map and then the simulation of every car that would be the traffic model with a density for a single road and so on.
Active Discussion;because otherwise the other cars just need to wait until no more cars actually crossing the traffic light and we need to take this into account.
Active Discussion;because otherwise this might result in a crash
Active Discussion;because then this might result in an accident
Active Discussion;if we have multiple intersections and then of course
Active Discussion;o maybe i mean, thatís the thing, you just have to draw a road, because all of them should have traffic lights
Active Discussion;so basically
Active Discussion;so i mean
Active Discussion;so maybe
Active Discussion;so that is i mean the easiest i guess
Active Discussion;so then you have an intersection
Active Discussion;so there is no undo
Active Discussion;so we can see what we
Active Discussion;so we have
Active Discussion;use the road symbol and also draw intersections like this then of course we would need to allow him to draw traffic light symbols in addition to that
Active Discussion;i guess i should put wait time here, capacity here.
Active Discussion;it should bepossible to create a busy road or a seldom used one, or any 0variation in between.
Active Discussion;so that'scase one, that's case one. case two would be we've got aleft-êhand turn and we're either yellow or
Active Discussion;the cop is looking at well state of thesignal and the some
Active Discussion;, that's the complication that arises when you allowthat, is you have to figure out how it's--
Active Discussion;. a cop is kind of controlling the state of the model
Active Discussion;also don't need to push on herebecause the--this, you don't need to randomly push on herebecause all the cars coming in this queue are going to becoming from this road. either from here, or from there.
Active Discussion;also maybe analyze the load on an intersection for road, fora particular road
Active Discussion;although i mean theoretically you could do somethinglike this
Active Discussion;and as well as the signal.
Active Discussion;and it also corresponds to time
Active Discussion;and so the copsays okay, i try to tick, the intersections says i'm still or thatlight says i'm still green, and let's suppose this guy has rulessaying every four ticks change the colors of the lights.
Active Discussion;and so, should we say the initial state would be this lightsgreen and this lights green.
Active Discussion;and that also maybe also [inaudible] as the right hand turn
Active Discussion;and the fact that we can't have a t-êjunction keeps us fromdoing things like that, right
Active Discussion;and the results of pushing and popping.
Active Discussion;and then depending on 3what type of car, you queue it up on the lane.
Active Discussion;and then some t, at some point t one later.
Active Discussion;as capacity increases, the wait time doesn't increaseproportionally
Active Discussion;because cars into this road can come from here goingstraight, here turning left, or here turning right
Active Discussion;because each road can have adifferent rate.
Active Discussion;because i think observegets into the analytics
Active Discussion;because i think one of the goals here is tocommunicate this to
Active Discussion;because i'm having trouble
Active Discussion;because i'm thinking
Active Discussion;because it can't turn ifthe road in the opposite has cars in it.
Active Discussion;because it kind of applies
Active Discussion;because it's the cop that's receiving the tick, right?
Active Discussion;because let'ssuppose we make it so every
Active Discussion;because now as you drag thisone over you've got to make sure to drag that one over
Active Discussion;because roads kind of come in pairs as faras we're concerned
Active Discussion;because that might be avariable way of entering
Active Discussion;because that then really shows the success of the networkoverall
Active Discussion;because that's a way tothen, you know that's a way to sort
Active Discussion;because that'sthe queue for the light.
Active Discussion;because the popping logic, you can't pop ifthe other road is full
Active Discussion;because the simulation is supposed to be not just one
Active Discussion;because thenwho's responsible for coordinating.
Active Discussion;because they've got to be
Active Discussion;because we have directional graph andwe have [inaudible] and dopplets of what's a valid graph
Active Discussion;because we're not supposed to have t-êjunctionswe're supposed to have...
Active Discussion;because you could also, imean, theoretically you could also have an intersectionwhere this goes left and straight and this is just red.
Active Discussion;because your'e talking abouta kind of combination of a rule and an action,
Active Discussion;because, forinstance if this
Active Discussion;because--so anyway we go through the intersection
Active Discussion;because--this would be interesting things tosimulate.
Active Discussion;but i think that would become a bit spaghetti
Active Discussion;controls
Active Discussion;crossing roads
Active Discussion;cuz that's something
Active Discussion;directional -- okay. i'm thinking this is a queue, this is aqueue, this a queue.
Active Discussion;evaluation should be, should we say areable to evaluate per intersection or per
Active Discussion;here, maybe we should do it a little moreformally
Active Discussion;i guess aspects of parameters of the simulation, really
Active Discussion;i guess in our view that's not always true
Active Discussion;i guess the only last thing isthere are cars that are created by the--cars that are createdessentially by the cop and introduced into onramp roads.and they have certain states, we've said.
Active Discussion;i guess the other thing that would be--the other big piecehere is analytics,
Active Discussion;i mean you could go top left
Active Discussion;i meant connecting intersections
Active Discussion;i think we canassume we have a video camera rolling and we can gothrough the other scenarios
Active Discussion;i want to evaluate success of each simulation.
Active Discussion;i'm thinking that would be implicit inthe sense that i drag a road vertical, and i drag a roadhorizontal and the geometric--
Active Discussion;i'm thinking, yeah, i'm thinking in terms of model-êviewcontroller
Active Discussion;i'm wondering with half an hour left if we need to thinkabout how to--
Active Discussion;inaudible] has a type for a
Active Discussion;it might not even matter so much in that
Active Discussion;it seems like maybe, because then you have to then it'sseparate then you have to do them in sync. so maybe it'sreally a function of the result of how the intersections arelaid out. and the relationship between the intersection
Active Discussion;it sort of seems like it is appropriate because a copneeds to look at the top of the queue, or needs to look at thetop of the queue to see what kind of car it is
Active Discussion;it's almost like you just step up a level and have anobject called a network and that's the thing that assemblesintersection out of roads and knows whether its an exteriorroad or an interior road and all that
Active Discussion;it's almost like you need to traffic cop, right, traffic copcontroller
Active Discussion;it's an interior road if anotherroad--because this says you're going in here and out here sois this--is an interior road just one queue or in general
Active Discussion;it's coming together though, i think. it's just more rules.
Active Discussion;it's going
Active Discussion;it's like there's a network kind of as well saying, okaywell we--i have, this line here says for each road in thesimulation do something.
Active Discussion;it's not going to work. that's
Active Discussion;it's really a geometric property of the road
Active Discussion;it's sayinghow far along are you in your road
Active Discussion;it'sreally just a list of road, road pairs i guess, and thenintersections
Active Discussion;maybe this is this card, this push notion right now and just ahand wave and have it happening in a global sense
Active Discussion;maybe we randomize the--at a pop and push. wealso then randomize the actual direction of the car.
Active Discussion;my first inclination is to say, okay the rules if rules can getpushed into the objects and then tick maybe into the--distribute the rules into the network and then at every tickeach aspect, each car gets a tick, each intersection gets atick, each road gets a tick.
Active Discussion;my initial thinking was you'd have intersection object thatcontained four roads they're all incoming roads
Active Discussion;now left-êturn is a little more special
Active Discussion;now we're looking at this visually is thisnotion of speed of the car through a particular road
Active Discussion;oh right, like a traffic jam
Active Discussion;one car per tic.
Active Discussion;one thing we could simplify is, in order to get--because thismatters
Active Discussion;say some number of cars per minute while the lights green.
Active Discussion;say start with a model and start with the simplestmodel to get the simplest intersection flowing with cars andtiming
Active Discussion;so i guess then [inaudible] is no pop
Active Discussion;so intersection then we need car, we need the notionof time, this is a simulation of time
Active Discussion;so maybe a drawing of a, the simplest intersection, right, andan intersection, and have a particular road would have -ê it'sdirectional on either side, right. there are some number ofcars flowing on a particular road waiting at an intersection.there is a clock, right, that governs when the lights change.so, there are lights, right. this goes across the street rightthere.
Active Discussion;so maybe we should run through some,you know, how pictures will change from one moment oftime to another and think about how the software wouldcreate those pictures maybe.
Active Discussion;so our onramp, offramp
Active Discussion;so the cop looks at the intersections says okay it's Creative Conflictn light on these roads. this road has some number ofcars in it. if the lights green one tick means we pop and wedo that queue and second picture. so, from t zero to t onethat's how we've gone through two
Active Discussion;so the frequency f here is not a global to the network, it's asetting on a particular onramp road.
Active Discussion;so two things: design and interaction
Active Discussion;so we have to have some sort of timer model that
Active Discussion;so what i'm thinking is maybe there's arandom number generator here that has two inputs of likebasically the probability, right
Active Discussion;so, let's say delta one tic maybe or something
Active Discussion;so, one thing wehaven't talked about is how we in queue a car.
Active Discussion;so, yeah i guess at a very base level we kick everything offwith main( ). right
Active Discussion;somehow we need to represent the amount of trafficor traffic flow
Active Discussion;speed of simulation
Active Discussion;speed of the car
Active Discussion;start, observe, and then we'll put pause
Active Discussion;that kicks off events and then which then make a [inaudible
Active Discussion;that kicks off events.
Active Discussion;that's another thing is thelight
Active Discussion;the classjust gets huge and you end up [inaudible] it. but yeah, i likethe [inaudible
Active Discussion;the cop, let's do--so it has sort of rules
Active Discussion;the lane would be an addition of the road with somespecific logic data.
Active Discussion;the next direction of the car.
Active Discussion;the other way
Active Discussion;then this way wecan, it's really the network that runs the road,
Active Discussion;then what we're really trying to do isminimize the wait time
Active Discussion;therandom number generator could saturate the space on theroads.
Active Discussion;there's rules governing if you have two carsgoing into the same road, which goes first per tick,
Active Discussion;this guywould have the sensor state,
Active Discussion;this is a queue and what we're reallyinterested in is how those cars queue up, how big the queuesget, when the queues release and how many we can pop-êupthe end of the queue for some given clock tick. then we cankeep speed constant for
Active Discussion;this is starting to sound very--i mean i can already see thelength of the source file for the car
Active Discussion;those are randomly generated, and maybe thetype of car has a random output
Active Discussion;traverser of network
Active Discussion;two queues.
Active Discussion;unless you're the terminator and you've beamed acar.
Active Discussion;until he passes the intersection, or whatever. and gets onthe next road
Active Discussion;we could make this pretty simple
Active Discussion;we have some constraints on the flow of the queuesbecause we can't have lights coming in a collision course.
Active Discussion;we need something that represents intersections.
Active Discussion;we should talk about road, got this modelcontrol
Active Discussion;well capacity is a good one to have because then you canevaluate wait time per
Active Discussion;well it seems like a lot of the logic is going to be--a lot of thecomplication is going to be in the push and pop actions
Active Discussion;we're saying there's a, so then, these are objects right.so, maybe what happens is the clock is the controller, it'schanging the state of time so time can tick, right, that's anamount of time. the clock does the ticking, right, and nowthe tick, time is part of model that is state, but as timechanges some cop object or something responds to timechanges, right, and is responsible for changing state ofmodel.
Active Discussion;what i'm thinking is like you have this data structure of thistraffic cop that responds to ticks by analyzing the state of thetraffic signal and then, you know, pushes cars on and offqueue depending on the -ê
Active Discussion;where it could be going. and theseare basically, these better be pointing
Active Discussion;where you put these roads determines how the queue,the maximum number of cars in an intersection
Active Discussion;whether it has a sensor, and maybe some logic around--sortof setting in the rules we need some sort of rule editor
Active Discussion;would that be a property of the car onthe current wait time or something like that
Active Discussion;yeah maybe let's start with thenetwork
Active Discussion;yeah we could make it all horizontal and vertical roads soyou start on, off, on, off, intersection,
Active Discussion;you can't pick up thisintersection, it would make sense to move the entire road
Active Discussion;the traffic pattern object, the big guy, owns all the cars,and as it manufactures them, as it factors them out, it createsthem in some flavor,
Active Discussion;we'll say you should getstarted on this much, we need to go and clarify this withprofessor e
Active Discussion;also
Active Discussion;and also
Active Discussion;and by default it eitherhas or does not have a timing setting, so very quickly you cancreate something without fussing with it too much, and bydefault it has to assume
Active Discussion;and it also seems like
Active Discussion;and that's my point
Active Discussion;and then there's some way to
Active Discussion;and then we have some way of saying
Active Discussion;becaues
Active Discussion;because
Active Discussion;because in real life some intersections you cannot.
Active Discussion;because it knows where it's going
Active Discussion;because thatjust made it complex
Active Discussion;because the road knows about intersections, and then thewhole map.
Active Discussion;becauseas you start adjusting here it would go here as you wouldósoyou can almost go infinite here so it has to, you just give it.
Active Discussion;becauseotherwise
Active Discussion;becausethat'd
Active Discussion;but
Active Discussion;but also i think
Active Discussion;but i'm saying that you would say that 10% of cars willbehave like this, 10% will go straight, 10% will go tointersections and turn
Active Discussion;but its not necessary
Active Discussion;but jim did we finish with the cars kind of
Active Discussion;but you know that you brought up a point you know
Active Discussion;cause there's a lot of complexity
Active Discussion;deally, thesystem should be able to
Active Discussion;either
Active Discussion;erhaps theres
Active Discussion;hat's going to cause traffic problems here.
Active Discussion;how do you assess, you know, what is the optimalósothis is the grid, what is the optimal setting of the intersectionconfigurations with this traffic pattern.
Active Discussion;how far is it between each leg orwhatever, each segment.
Active Discussion;i could see in subsequent versions
Active Discussion;i feel likeyou should have to specify only maybe two directions orsomething
Active Discussion;i guess
Active Discussion;i guess that's all.
Active Discussion;i just think
Active Discussion;i like it better down there
Active Discussion;i mean
Active Discussion;i mean we couldjust say, you know, the distance between 1st street and 2ndstreet is this,
Active Discussion;i mean, we have to state this because if it's notó
Active Discussion;i think
Active Discussion;i think from the user's perspective
Active Discussion;i think it's just saying
Active Discussion;i think that's an importantpart of it
Active Discussion;i think the intersections just occur.
Active Discussion;i think this
Active Discussion;i think we kind of covered all thethings we wrote up here
Active Discussion;i think wehave to talk to professor e again, because she didn't specify themost important aspect of it, which is how do you know thatyour lighting system is working to its best potential? i candraw the map, i can specify all these parameters and now i runit, how do i know this is good
Active Discussion;i think we're going to have to rely on professor e forcreating the details about the theory of how that works. i mean,we might have to code whatever her understanding is of trafficlight theory into it
Active Discussion;i want to do
Active Discussion;i would go
Active Discussion;i would probably wantto be able to hover and somehow in?place edit
Active Discussion;i would say
Active Discussion;if
Active Discussion;i'll tell you what's going to be interesting is these students,whether there's civil engineers but, you know they're doingcomputer science stuff, so their next step after this is to takethe software that you've been given and program the smartsinto it so that it can do the timing for you automatically.
Active Discussion;i'm entertaining this idea
Active Discussion;i'm still unhappy
Active Discussion;i'm thinking
Active Discussion;i'mguessing
Active Discussion;in other words
Active Discussion;in other words it would seem to me that ideally you'dwant to draw this out of the box with all defaults and somedefault settings based on some package
Active Discussion;in other words,
Active Discussion;in the real world, you know, a can becurving and intersect 1 three times, and do an s and dead?end.
Active Discussion;is the traffic kind ofóyou know how some you havegreen one way but not on the other.
Active Discussion;is there a sensor?'
Active Discussion;it almost seems like
Active Discussion;it also seems
Active Discussion;it didn't sound like you need control at the individual carlevel
Active Discussion;it does seemlike
Active Discussion;it might
Active Discussion;it might be
Active Discussion;it seems like here,
Active Discussion;ithink
Active Discussion;let's start coding
Active Discussion;like during commuting hours everyoneworks over there, but the shopping center is down there, so onweekends everyone is going that way.
Active Discussion;like it could be like
Active Discussion;maybe
Active Discussion;maybe even you could
Active Discussion;maybe just click here
Active Discussion;maybe the way to approach
Active Discussion;maybe theres also
Active Discussion;maybe this is just a learning tool
Active Discussion;next release we'll let them add theirown fancy street names
Active Discussion;o i would take the map drawingas one thing
Active Discussion;o professor e says,this is your exam this is your project, here is a traffic pattern,this is the grid, what is the optimal traffic light settings? figurethat out. and so how do you, you know, and again i think itwould be up to the customer, the professor, in this case, tospecify what optimal means, what is allowed wait?time, howmany traffic, you know people waiting on the lights, right, all ofthat.
Active Discussion;of course we're not going and talking to her, we're going to talkto the team of software developers
Active Discussion;okay so then we have a map
Active Discussion;okay, i say i want fifty cars on the grid, but i don't want themall going the same way.
Active Discussion;one thing that we're kind of missing there
Active Discussion;right now i would just leave it
Active Discussion;should not allow
Active Discussion;so
Active Discussion;so i think
Active Discussion;so i would start simple, jim.
Active Discussion;so if we did 2 minutes, that's 120 seconds. so the entireduration is 120 seconds
Active Discussion;so it could be
Active Discussion;so let's build
Active Discussion;so let's just say for
Active Discussion;so lets say somehow we figure it all out and we'reable to pump traffic through it
Active Discussion;so maybe that's a separate setting. in other words, the durationof each light you set it on, maybe 1 or 2 but the other one isimplied. because if this is green, then you cannot tell thesystem to make the other one green as well it just won'thappen. so you only set one, but the overlap of the red and theduration of the yellow is something you can set.
Active Discussion;so that'slike a final stage, how do you report the results
Active Discussion;so the form needs to be
Active Discussion;so there's lik
Active Discussion;so this can get fairly complex very fast because you have allthese intersections
Active Discussion;so we assume they have some sort of a pallet here where theygrab a road and they start dragging and then they drag that, sothere is some sort of drawing pallet right, that says okay i havethis thing i drag something, i'm drawing a road and i call itsomething and i draw and i call it b and i draw my roads andthen.
Active Discussion;"so what does ""it worked"" mean?"
Active Discussion;so why don't we start out
Active Discussion;so you don't have to
Active Discussion;so, like yousaid, if you click on here and double click on here then there'ssome form that lets you collect the information about thatintersection.
Active Discussion;soyou can mix and match
Active Discussion;t does seem like it would begood
Active Discussion;t has a computer, i would have to think about it reallyhard.
Active Discussion;talk through this with me
Active Discussion;that it would have tobe like flex or something
Active Discussion;that why i though
Active Discussion;that, and it also pushesit up to the road, so the road can aggregate, create the reportslater for all the intersections it has so we can aggregate thesething, so you can aggregate so you can get individualinformation on each car, on each intersection, on each road
Active Discussion;the distances, you know
Active Discussion;the intersection knows how many cars it has, and fullinventory of each car's direction, status, waiting, and waitingfor what.
Active Discussion;the left?hand turns are
Active Discussion;then i think
Active Discussion;then it makes it easier tokind of find it and it maps really closely to what you see overhere.
Active Discussion;there because doingit on the side can get kind of confusing
Active Discussion;there has to be
Active Discussion;there might be
Active Discussion;there was something about reducing wait?time and
Active Discussion;think
Active Discussion;think that
Active Discussion;this has to be like the main objec
Active Discussion;this is an approach
Active Discussion;want tostart off and say i have
Active Discussion;we
Active Discussion;we build a flex application
Active Discussion;we could have
Active Discussion;we could talk to the engineers too
Active Discussion;we have to be able to describe the behavior of thetraffic lights at each intersection.
Active Discussion;we haven't really,this is where we find some conflict
Active Discussion;we haven't yet worked thesensors
Active Discussion;we need to collect it as part of the approach to the intersection
Active Discussion;we still have to do thedetail design for how you specify these numbers
Active Discussion;well itdepends
Active Discussion;well, these are almost given
Active Discussion;what does ramming mean
Active Discussion;what does that mean? what isthe sensor sensoring? or detecting?
Active Discussion;with or without an optionto
Active Discussion;yeah, because that's a huge wrinkle if it's not.
Active Discussion;you can just give it a density andit just follows these rules
Active Discussion;you know, in some ways it seems
Active Discussion;you know, we should think about that
Active Discussion;you need some control with the flow
Active Discussion;you start simply.
Active Discussion;you'd set a rate
Active Discussion;you're completely just withdrawing the map
Active Discussion;because i mean if you're going
Active Discussion;especially withthe leftÇ-hand turn requirement
Active Discussion;i mean, the roads have a length
Active Discussion;i think, kind of the we would have to use[inaudible
Active Discussion;i thinkwe just go off the number of signals at each intersection.
Active Discussion;know it stops, it stopsnecessarily adding cars to this road,
Active Discussion;let's see what other
Active Discussion;think one thing is that the controls have to modify the signaltimings and the sensors so we basically got to just basically sayhere's
Active Discussion;think that at that point,we don't really care.
Active Discussion;think there's another thing you captured here. there'sthese inputs. and the road can actually have or, you know.
Active Discussion;think we can make that first clean division
Active Discussion;think, is the model on which to build the end userapplication.
Active Discussion;also, i mean it seems
Active Discussion;and it just tell them, hey full or heyi don't have any. so it's not it's own little thinking component.
Active Discussion;and it's significant because it holds anumber of cars.
Active Discussion;and then test it, are you full?
Active Discussion;and then you just have dictate people waiting for that turnare going to pile up as if it was straight
Active Discussion;aslong asÇ-also being able to control
Active Discussion;because all i'm saying it is, is basically you have a source
Active Discussion;because at that point the rules more apply to the intersectionitself as opposed to any one individual signal
Active Discussion;"because basically it's going to have given s1 goesgreen, it's going to have to delegate the actions of what s2 and s3are;"
Active Discussion;because eachintersection is going to have four
Active Discussion;because i could see they'd want to clickthe
Active Discussion;because i think really we care more about the signals at thatindividual intersection.
Active Discussion;because if there's a leftÇ-turn light, and they have straight light, aprotected left
Active Discussion;because if you have a light dictating left, it's always goingto be a left turn and straight and more often
Active Discussion;because i'm coming back to this now, becausetechnically our queue is
Active Discussion;because imean you could eventually be taken off theÇ-once you leave theroad
Active Discussion;because imean. there's a time element, because if the cars are stacking upat the intersection as opposed to free flowing in over twentyminutes.
Active Discussion;because it holds anumber of cars.
Active Discussion;because it seems like there should be a
Active Discussion;because it's really kind of thismeta
Active Discussion;because it'sgoing to have all the information it needs to know whether a carshould be continuing through or not
Active Discussion;because one lane isalways going, is always continuing through so if this is down toone lane you'd have one lane going straight, one lane feeding intothe leftÇ-hand turn, which is i mean i think it's fine
Active Discussion;because really all they're saying is to be able to change trafficdensity
Active Discussion;because that is reallygoing to affect the complexity of the problem and so,
Active Discussion;because thecars need to know how fast they can actually move with othercars in front of them.
Active Discussion;because thenyou have a way to connect up what each intersection connects upto and stuff.
Active Discussion;because there are two differenttimes.
Active Discussion;because there's aÇ-yeah that's what i was trying to
Active Discussion;because they said you know they need to be able to control theinput coming in. okay.
Active Discussion;because they should have two way traffic going betweentwoÇ-way intersections
Active Discussion;because this road is filling up,its queue is filling up, and it needs to drain
Active Discussion;because we canmake the assumption of just two lanes everywhere
Active Discussion;because, i mean, unless we care because given a certain road youcan have different lanes leading up to each intersection, it didn'treally
Active Discussion;becauseasÇ-if this road fills up, it's going to have to know i'm full
Active Discussion;"becausestraight, depending unless you're going to have an explicit rightturn lane, straight is going to have to worry about rights as well;they're in the same queue essentially. i'll just put right there iguess."
Active Discussion;direction. left, straight
Active Discussion;i could see a situation where you want to justÇ-you have xnumber of cars queued up, you say i'm going to stop this for nowbut you still want that throughÇ-put to go through even though ithasn't necessarily hit this intersection yet
Active Discussion;i guess that dependency is really comes back to the signals
Active Discussion;i guess the issues that are going to come into play are
Active Discussion;i mean with that they havetwo intersections coming to four turn lanes, i mean that's theproblem
Active Discussion;i think it's a simplification
Active Discussion;i think it's just more consistent
Active Discussion;i think it's more of a collection of signals because
Active Discussion;i think its more of the number of cars in period of time
Active Discussion;i think really we care more about
Active Discussion;i think that these are the only ones that should be toggable
Active Discussion;i think the road's going to have to be a little bit smarter
Active Discussion;i think theintersection's going toÇ-basically its interface is looking at that,its going to say road give me left cars, give me straight cars, giveme right cars
Active Discussion;i think there's aÇ-should be [inaudible] this if not just two fulllanes
Active Discussion;i think they're pretty straightÇ-forwardobjects
Active Discussion;i think those were the main big players
Active Discussion;i think we have
Active Discussion;i'm saying this is probably the best assumption
Active Discussion;i'm trying to think from how youwould actually manipulate this
Active Discussion;imean it comes back to this whole problem that we were toyingwith.
Active Discussion;imean they can't make a left
Active Discussion;i'mtrying to figure out how to capture the state of a car going down aspecific road
Active Discussion;it just consists of a set of intersectionsconnected
Active Discussion;it seems like a, for this type of problem a good first attack is justkind of a, you know a data analysis
Active Discussion;its going to be significant
Active Discussion;it's kind of a combination of clock and then there's also[inaudible
Active Discussion;it's two lanes, one of them
Active Discussion;just to get your thoughts.
Active Discussion;kind of a twice [inaudible
Active Discussion;kind of the situation of how they are physically doesn't matter,we just more care about what's leading up to it, and what it'sleading off to.
Active Discussion;sensorÇ-driven
Active Discussion;so how are these signalsÇ-trying to pull out our data
Active Discussion;so i think one of the things we'recoming out is the roadÇ-i don't know if it has lanes so much as ithas, you know left, straight, right.
Active Discussion;so it's interesting becausethe intersection has signals and the intersection has some controlof the signals.
Active Discussion;so let's go with the minimum so
Active Discussion;so maybe the data structure is set up where we don'tcare, i don't think we do care
Active Discussion;so we
Active Discussion;sounds like at each individual lane. on top of that,and being able to basically control the amount of cars goingthrough and certain flows in certain areas.
Active Discussion;that's the real scenario
Active Discussion;that's why i'm trying tothink, the lanes aren't necessarily so important as whichintersection does it get you to next
Active Discussion;the left turn really introduces a lot of problems
Active Discussion;the onlything the lanes are really going to affect is...how the lights affectus
Active Discussion;the problem is you can chop up lanes
Active Discussion;the problem with that is the variable path.
Active Discussion;the road would actually own what traffic it expects tobe traveling on it
Active Discussion;the signals. actual signals.
Active Discussion;the traffic wants to know.
Active Discussion;there's a time for each of those. tÇ-r, tÇ-yellow, tÇ-green
Active Discussion;there'stime,
Active Discussion;they have signals
Active Discussion;traffic
Active Discussion;we can say iÇ-
Active Discussion;we could play withthat. because these are the big state changes. yellow has nodifference really
Active Discussion;we don't want to get into
Active Discussion;we just more care about
Active Discussion;we might have multiple inputs and they're all going to have to sayhere's cars coming at you. and at that point the road justbecomes a queue and just keeps on popping on cars, and thenthey keep, they'll just pop off the queue.
Active Discussion;we might have to say add left caradd straight car, there might be more to the road i'm starting tothink.
Active Discussion;well it's a queue with a limit
Active Discussion;well it's more of a stops. it's more of a stops flow starts flow kindof thing
Active Discussion;what i'm wondering is that, is it one of thoseÇ-
Active Discussion;yeah i'm justÇ-do a flat file, sterilize it all
Active Discussion;you know, the leftcan go at the same time and then.
Active Discussion;i guess should be to have a look at congestion and see how many cars can actually get through during a certain amount of time
Active Discussion;i guess there needs to be a timer for
Active Discussion;i have traffic density can be changed.
Active Discussion;i think itís useful,
Active Discussion;i think the sensors are on the road rather connecting the intersections rather than on the intersection
Active Discussion;it could be that this is roads specific
Active Discussion;. you would have some kind of patterns for traffic lights, different ones which you will use on different intersections
Active Discussion;ah okay, road. we would have roads
Active Discussion;although for roads it would be a bit more tricky because i mean if we zoom in the sign that every road has two intersections, it doesnít fit, because at the edges of the map we have to have something else.
Active Discussion;at least a starting point and end point
Active Discussion;for me itís the traffic on a single road
Active Discussion;from my understanding it was like for the for the designer yes, the designer of the traffic just wants to define traffic either on the road or as input output for the system on endpoints,
Active Discussion;i donít see anything.
Active Discussion;i donít think that you want to redefine it for each intersection again and again if the timing is the same
Active Discussion;i guess it relates to if we should do this system level simulation or not, otherwise it doesnít make sense to have it.
Active Discussion;i guess the map can stay there
Active Discussion;i guess there should be some statistics in terms of like the total throughput of the system or something like that. runtime statistics
Active Discussion;i guess this four is representing what is required right now
Active Discussion;i guess timing behavior would be something in relation to traffic lights
Active Discussion;i guess we could do it as a hit map for the road in visualization mode
Active Discussion;i mean if we are going for a more model-view-controller pattern or something like that maybe we want to separate the visualization in some sense so that the visualization part would be, would have the play buttons and the simulations and all of that.
Active Discussion;i mean if you have an open ended road you should somehow be able to define that only one end should have an intersection and the other one should have not
Active Discussion;i mean the combination of possible roads would become a combinatorial exploration
Active Discussion;i mean the naÔve way to go about it would just start with a map and then assume that everything is a subset of a map.
Active Discussion;i mean they should contain information like density and optionally it may have speed limits and so on.
Active Discussion;i think we should then move to stages sooner or later
Active Discussion;i would like to use the abstraction level we have here at the requirement level
Active Discussion;i would say we have a visual item and that could be either road or traffic light or car
Active Discussion;iím just clarifying that there should be four traffic lights for each intersection, not a single one.
Active Discussion;iím just thinking about the different other possible use cases.
Active Discussion;it is: behavior can be defined at each intersection
Active Discussion;it would be road property i think
Active Discussion;maybe we can also move it. maybe itís possible, i can try
Active Discussion;maybe we donít even need a tool box
Active Discussion;maybe we just keep this in mind and then itís fine
Active Discussion;maybe we should clarify that and say that there should be one traffic light at each entry point into the intersection
Active Discussion;maybe we should clarify that each entry point into the intersection
Active Discussion;maybe you want to calculate exactly how long it takes for a single car to go from one end to the other end of the map or something like that
Active Discussion;mean we send it to be part of the intersection
Active Discussion;now i have another road and here is my first intersection. and now iím adding another road and here i have another intersection
Active Discussion;should we also include the velocity, the speed limits of the cars
Active Discussion;so i guess the visual map is to replay the simulation and the road layout is to create new simulations
Active Discussion;so i would expect some overall either 2-d or 3-d visualization where you can directly create your traffics and then you could push some button on saying simulate and maybe during the simulation at runtime you can also change some parts, like changing the traffic density, velocity or the traffic light behavior.
Active Discussion;so what i would like to have is some kind of traffic library
Active Discussion;speed limit i would say rather
Active Discussion;thatís just to kind of make it visually appealing in the map mode.
Active Discussion;the first one was for me that we need a visual map
Active Discussion;the first thing is only that everything is layouted. it could be also both but this is more detailed meaning that in this visual map. so the map at all i donít know how much details we have, but itís just the surrounding and base don that you can add roads.
Active Discussion;the timing behavior would be something related to traffic lights.
Active Discussion;then the next one was: there are optional sensors for car detection.
Active Discussion;there seems to be two moves
Active Discussion;this is a road. i added a road to the system
Active Discussion;to the roads, not the intersections
Active Discussion;we also need to look at how fast the cars are while crossing each intersection.
Active Discussion;we canít have an open ended intersections or open ended roads.
Active Discussion;we could do such a thing
Active Discussion;we could either now think about some technical aspects meaning for the visualization on the letís say more component diagram level which items do we need or maybe first of all we maybe make a class diagram for the different items, which should be represented by the software referencing to the requirements
Active Discussion;we could have some kind of input traffic, but the traffic is already designed per road
Active Discussion;we just use this part as a new road and this part as a new road
Active Discussion;we start with the plane map without any roads and then we can add some.
Active Discussion;what did i say? ìroad endpointsî, four and one. then we would have ìroadî
Active Discussion;yes maybe road traffic
Active Discussion;yes, how much in detail thatís something we can discuss
Active Discussion;you have the speed limit of the roads, but then also the velocity of the cars
Active Discussion;you should hopefully be able to see what the throughput is.
Active Discussion;also we have it on the laptop screen
Active Discussion;am trying to remember how thatís in real traffic
Active Discussion;because basically i mean, you could basically finish the
Active Discussion;because with the difficulties in the offset itís a bit problematic to draw this
Active Discussion;also before we draw again so first i can right now try to save the image
Active Discussion;another question is: which way the user can put a car onto the lane, as then there might be different starting points where cars can
Active Discussion;at the start of the road you can create new cars or define the number of cars, whether they want to, changing it during the simulation
Active Discussion;because for some reason i thought that by clicking the select button and selecting a part i would be able to move this selected part to some other place in the
Active Discussion;because i am not sure whether
Active Discussion;because i have basically forgot what was written
Active Discussion;because then it would be interesting to have like roads with the turning lanes and stuff and see how that affects the flow
Active Discussion;because then you can have a green wave for example
Active Discussion;because there is quite a lot of information we have to present somehow
Active Discussion;because we need a reference point.
Active Discussion;but i think we need for, do we need this for one intersection
Active Discussion;but that, yeah, i mean, thatís the thing, they will always work in pairs, it doesnít matter if it is 3 or 1, that have a car, just that itís, i mean north and south, or up and down
Active Discussion;erhaps we have somewhat, five seconds orange, 30 seconds green
Active Discussion;from other intersections
Active Discussion;i am thinking maybe we should have that in,
Active Discussion;i donít know, 10 cars per minute, or whatever way you want to define it then itís actually in this, in this certain interval it just produces new cars and shows new cars crossing the traffic lights, something like this
Active Discussion;i guess a common, atleast here in sweden is that the main road is always green if it doesnít detect anything coming from the crossing roads so the big road is always green but when thereís cars coming in from left or right it detects that and then it sets the main road to red so that they can join
Active Discussion;i guess we should have a play button for the simulation and when you hit that one, it starts with the one that is marked
Active Discussion;i mean if you should be able to create like green waves and stuff.
Active Discussion;i mean it would be more fun to have turning
Active Discussion;i mean must still identify it as an intersection
Active Discussion;i mean so every start of a road that has just starting is, i guess an entry point then and then you can set it on these, so here
Active Discussion;i think i read it somewhere, letís just assume that it was written somewhere
Active Discussion;i think i would actually, like something like this that you can put some points on this and i donít know, a car spawner or whatever and say click on it and the you say another one, another one, another one so that the user can basically decide, where to put it and create as many cars as he likes to
Active Discussion;i think perhaps we can
Active Discussion;i think the more interesting and the more challenging part is behavior of the traffic lights
Active Discussion;i would like this to be an intersection automatically
Active Discussion;it depends on how we want the users to interact with,
Active Discussion;letís see, combinations of individual signals should not be
Active Discussion;maybe itís enough to set those
Active Discussion;maybe we have a delay where nothing happens and then it just goes through the flow here and when that one is done it jumps to the up and down again, because as you said, up and down and left and right will be the same, right?
Active Discussion;mean depending on how it works, yeah, exactly, so do we have to prevent them to be both, they shouldnít be green at the same time, thatís an obvious one, but could they be orange at the same time but in different phases, one before it turns red and one before it turns green.
Active Discussion;mean the traffic lights look good now, i think
Active Discussion;mean what you could do is just control how long each of them are green and then the other one is gone be red automatically so then you can say ok this one is going to be green for, i donít know, whatís normal, but 20 seconds and this one is going to be green for 30 seconds and then they just go back and forth
Active Discussion;mean, this one turning red, that one that we were talking about, could trigger the flow in this one
Active Discussion;o maybe it should be, only enters at end of roads somewhere
Active Discussion;ok itís a bad idea to arrange it according to the direction of the lane
Active Discussion;ok you mean to achieve the green
Active Discussion;ok, so we do not have like a circle or like a closed system of streets but
Active Discussion;or should we just say here, here you just spawn cars, oh no, another way, here and here and here and here
Active Discussion;perhaps we could draw some simple examples of what it could look like.
Active Discussion;so i am thinking, how to represent the sequence because if you have it like that you can have like a box here or somewhere else which says, ok, this sequence is triggered by signal two becoming green.
Active Discussion;so i think perhaps we can just focus on the traffic light and the description of the behavior before we draw anything again
Active Discussion;so i think, whatís possible, correct me if you disCreative Conflict, it might be possible that there is no car on lane 1 and there are cars on lane 3, so just because no cars one lane 1 does mean that you can turn traffic light 2 to green, because if a car is at 3 then there might be an accident by this.
Active Discussion;so in this case it is like in 1 has no, 1 no car and three no car, so you can turn 2 and 4, i donít know, something like this.
Active Discussion;so once again before we can probably, or how is it done? we need to consider those, both traffic lights again so, so this one and this one, another simplified version
Active Discussion;so that one crossing does that one turn orange when they one going down to up when that one one turns red
Active Discussion;so the question is how they should interact with the traffic lights, i guess.
Active Discussion;so the question, we gonna have to think about when traffic light are turning orange
Active Discussion;so then i mean if you set the one going up and down, down and up, to be green for 30 seconds, orange for 10 then you know that the other one gonna be red for at least 40 if i remember the numbers i used.
Active Discussion;so this should be easy the main question here is i guess
Active Discussion;so we do not need to, the user doesnít need to draw a new kind of symbol as similar to the net but itís
Active Discussion;so we need to find a way to, for the user to describe the behavior
Active Discussion;so yo click on it and then you set that
Active Discussion;so you have a long road and each intersection will be green when the car arrives
Active Discussion;so, yeah, some way of indicating where it will start
Active Discussion;t they could just cross the traffic lights and also next to them
Active Discussion;that you define it in the user interface if you if you describe the behavior, perhaps like, i donít know. i mean it may just probably not, perhaps not a main for reference
Active Discussion;thatís, this was just how it is depicted by the, this was just a proposal for how it is depicted by the system
Active Discussion;the last sentence of the fourth point
Active Discussion;the question is whether
Active Discussion;the question is whether we could give this to our advantage
Active Discussion;then letís say that maybe there is a delay before the other starts it sequence being orange and then
Active Discussion;then our system would need to detect this and put, i guess, switch this to, i donít know, orange or, i think itís a problem that you could draw, this problems my draw, something was wrong before, so we would probably need to change this to red light and then this to orange or green and this switching right.
Active Discussion;then you can say that ok this sequence is triggered by this signal turning green for example so when this other turns green then the sequence will go and then you can have
Active Discussion;we could actually draw some kind of car symbol there
Active Discussion;we just have to, like one traffic light at the beginning, something like this. so then we know for sure that the first car can drive up here, so some other car can also for 35 seconds at least.
Active Discussion;we need to assume some kind of absolute time
Active Discussion;we need to make sure that the traffic light to the right
Active Discussion;we need to make sure that this cannot happen.
Active Discussion;we say 45 and then i donít know, maybe we set orange afterwards as well, so this is that one that this, that one we talked about first, the one going down and up, when that one is red, this flow triggers, so it just goes back and forth and then maybe as you said
Active Discussion;with the green wave.
Active Discussion;yeah, main or start or whatever
Active Discussion;yeah, so maybe we should draw it a little bit bigger, i mean because there is quite a lot of information we have to present somehow.
Active Discussion;yeah, so this should be always be shown on the bottom in this way here.
Active Discussion;yes, a minimap
Active Discussion;you should be able to say how many cars per or something it should create
Active Discussion;howcongested is it?
Active Discussion;and that would be what?
Active Discussion;so what basic data structures are we looking at here?
Active Discussion;what elsedo we have
Active Discussion;what would this guy have?
Active Discussion;and where do you see
Active Discussion;are there other objects?
Active Discussion;but does it have only lefthand?
Active Discussion;distances, and density relate to it?
Active Discussion;he second?
Active Discussion;how do you know who's waiting and why
Active Discussion;that green is on?
Active Discussion;then, what was the information wehad
Active Discussion;what are the goals, and how are they set
Active Discussion;where was the part where there was something about waittime
Active Discussion;does it say anything about the number of lanes?
Active Discussion;how do we?
Active Discussion;is there a leftÇ-turn lane, or is it a suicide left?
Active Discussion;so nowcome back up, what big concepts haven't we captured yet
Active Discussion;what are we seeing here
Active Discussion;whatproperties of roads we have to worry about
Active Discussion;do we have something in vision
Active Discussion;are you writing anything right now?
Active Discussion;do you have other points regarding what you can design on the map?
Active Discussion;do you have something else?
Active Discussion;how do we continue based on that?
Active Discussion;how do you know where one road starts and where one ends?
Active Discussion;is this something which is defined in the task or do you think itís just optional we could add it?
Active Discussion;okay, so visual map would be houses and the cars travelling on the road and so on?
Active Discussion;so what was the question?
Active Discussion;the only thing that is actually set is the density per road what would that view contain?
Active Discussion;the question is what do you want to do as a designer?
Active Discussion;the question is what is a road?
Active Discussion;what is it?
Active Discussion;what more do we have as part of the intersection?
Active Discussion;what was it
Active Discussion;what was it?
Active Discussion;what was your point?
Active Discussion;where did you write?
Active Discussion;yes, so anything else?
Active Discussion;you asked if we have another attribute for intersection?
Active Discussion;you mean each traffic light?
Active Discussion;do we have something in vision
Active Discussion;are you writing anything right now?
Active Discussion;do you have other points regarding what you can design on the map?
Active Discussion;do you have something else?
Active Discussion;how do we continue based on that?
Active Discussion;how do you know where one road starts and where one ends?
Active Discussion;is this something which is defined in the task or do you think itís just optional we could add it?
Active Discussion;okay, so visual map would be houses and the cars travelling on the road and so on?
Active Discussion;so what was the question?
Active Discussion;the only thing that is actually set is the density per road what would that view contain?
Active Discussion;the question is what do you want to do as a designer?
Active Discussion;the question is what is a road?
Active Discussion;what is it?
Active Discussion;what more do we have as part of the intersection?
Active Discussion;what was it
Active Discussion;what was it?
Active Discussion;what was your point?
Active Discussion;where did you write?
Active Discussion;yes, so anything else?
Active Discussion;you asked if we have another attribute for intersection?
Active Discussion;you mean each traffic light?
Active Discussion;do we have to do something
Active Discussion;because
Active Discussion;because you would have to moveseveral blocks at the same time.
Active Discussion;do we really have an actual intersection as an item or is it just indirectly given if you do an intersection?
Active Discussion;is it currently disturbing
Active Discussion;is it mentioned in the task or do you just think it would be useful?
Active Discussion;. a cop is kind of controlling the state of the model
Active Discussion;also don't need to push on herebecause the--this, you don't need to randomly push on herebecause all the cars coming in this queue are going to becoming from this road. either from here, or from there.
Active Discussion;although i mean theoretically you could do somethinglike this
Active Discussion;because cars into this road can come from here goingstraight, here turning left, or here turning right
Active Discussion;because each road can have adifferent rate.
Active Discussion;because i think one of the goals here is tocommunicate this to
Active Discussion;because i'm having trouble
Active Discussion;because i'm thinking
Active Discussion;because it can't turn ifthe road in the opposite has cars in it.
Active Discussion;because it kind of applies
Active Discussion;because it's the cop that's receiving the tick, right?
Active Discussion;because let'ssuppose we make it so every
Active Discussion;because now as you drag thisone over you've got to make sure to drag that one over
Active Discussion;because roads kind of come in pairs as faras we're concerned
Active Discussion;because that might be avariable way of entering
Active Discussion;because that then really shows the success of the networkoverall
Active Discussion;because that's a way tothen, you know that's a way to sort
Active Discussion;because that'sthe queue for the light.
Active Discussion;because the popping logic, you can't pop ifthe other road is full
Active Discussion;because the simulation is supposed to be not just one
Active Discussion;because thenwho's responsible for coordinating.
Active Discussion;because they've got to be
Active Discussion;because we have directional graph andwe have [inaudible] and dopplets of what's a valid graph
Active Discussion;because we're not supposed to have t-êjunctionswe're supposed to have...
Active Discussion;because you could also, imean, theoretically you could also have an intersectionwhere this goes left and straight and this is just red.
Active Discussion;because your'e talking abouta kind of combination of a rule and an action,
Active Discussion;because, forinstance if this
Active Discussion;because--so anyway we go through the intersection
Active Discussion;because--this would be interesting things tosimulate.
Active Discussion;it seems like maybe, because then you have to then it'sseparate then you have to do them in sync. so maybe it'sreally a function of the result of how the intersections arelaid out. and the relationship between the intersection
Active Discussion;it sort of seems like it is appropriate because a copneeds to look at the top of the queue, or needs to look at thetop of the queue to see what kind of car it is
Active Discussion;it's an interior road if anotherroad--because this says you're going in here and out here sois this--is an interior road just one queue or in general
Active Discussion;one thing we could simplify is, in order to get--because thismatters
Active Discussion;the classjust gets huge and you end up [inaudible] it. but yeah, i likethe [inaudible
Active Discussion;therandom number generator could saturate the space on theroads.
Active Discussion;well capacity is a good one to have because then you canevaluate wait time per
Active Discussion;well it seems like a lot of the logic is going to be--a lot of thecomplication is going to be in the push and pop actions
Active Discussion;where it could be going. and theseare basically, these better be pointing
Active Discussion;you can't pick up thisintersection, it would make sense to move the entire road
Active Discussion;and that's my point
Active Discussion;becaues
Active Discussion;because in real life some intersections you cannot.
Active Discussion;because it knows where it's going
Active Discussion;because thatjust made it complex
Active Discussion;because the road knows about intersections, and then thewhole map.
Active Discussion;becauseas you start adjusting here it would go here as you wouldósoyou can almost go infinite here so it has to, you just give it.
Active Discussion;becauseotherwise
Active Discussion;becausethat'd
Active Discussion;but
Active Discussion;but its not necessary
Active Discussion;cause there's a lot of complexity
Active Discussion;hat's going to cause traffic problems here.
Active Discussion;i mean
Active Discussion;i mean, we have to state this because if it's notó
Active Discussion;if
Active Discussion;in the real world, you know, a can becurving and intersect 1 three times, and do an s and dead?end.
Active Discussion;is the traffic kind ofóyou know how some you havegreen one way but not on the other.
Active Discussion;like during commuting hours everyoneworks over there, but the shopping center is down there, so onweekends everyone is going that way.
Active Discussion;o professor e says,this is your exam this is your project, here is a traffic pattern,this is the grid, what is the optimal traffic light settings? figurethat out. and so how do you, you know, and again i think itwould be up to the customer, the professor, in this case, tospecify what optimal means, what is allowed wait?time, howmany traffic, you know people waiting on the lights, right, all ofthat.
Active Discussion;so
Active Discussion;so maybe that's a separate setting. in other words, the durationof each light you set it on, maybe 1 or 2 but the other one isimplied. because if this is green, then you cannot tell thesystem to make the other one green as well it just won'thappen. so you only set one, but the overlap of the red and theduration of the yellow is something you can set.
Active Discussion;so this can get fairly complex very fast because you have allthese intersections
Active Discussion;so you don't have to
Active Discussion;soyou can mix and match
Active Discussion;that why i though
Active Discussion;then it makes it easier tokind of find it and it maps really closely to what you see overhere.
Active Discussion;there because doingit on the side can get kind of confusing
Active Discussion;we
Active Discussion;we could talk to the engineers too
Active Discussion;well itdepends
Active Discussion;well, these are almost given
Active Discussion;yeah, because that's a huge wrinkle if it's not.
Active Discussion;because i mean if you're going
Active Discussion;especially withthe leftÇ-hand turn requirement
Active Discussion;because all i'm saying it is, is basically you have a source
Active Discussion;because at that point the rules more apply to the intersectionitself as opposed to any one individual signal
Active Discussion;"because basically it's going to have given s1 goesgreen, it's going to have to delegate the actions of what s2 and s3are;"
Active Discussion;because eachintersection is going to have four
Active Discussion;because i could see they'd want to clickthe
Active Discussion;because i think really we care more about the signals at thatindividual intersection.
Active Discussion;because if there's a leftÇ-turn light, and they have straight light, aprotected left
Active Discussion;because if you have a light dictating left, it's always goingto be a left turn and straight and more often
Active Discussion;because i'm coming back to this now, becausetechnically our queue is
Active Discussion;because imean you could eventually be taken off theÇ-once you leave theroad
Active Discussion;because imean. there's a time element, because if the cars are stacking upat the intersection as opposed to free flowing in over twentyminutes.
Active Discussion;because it holds anumber of cars.
Active Discussion;because it seems like there should be a
Active Discussion;because it's really kind of thismeta
Active Discussion;because it'sgoing to have all the information it needs to know whether a carshould be continuing through or not
Active Discussion;because one lane isalways going, is always continuing through so if this is down toone lane you'd have one lane going straight, one lane feeding intothe leftÇ-hand turn, which is i mean i think it's fine
Active Discussion;because really all they're saying is to be able to change trafficdensity
Active Discussion;because that is reallygoing to affect the complexity of the problem and so,
Active Discussion;because thecars need to know how fast they can actually move with othercars in front of them.
Active Discussion;because thenyou have a way to connect up what each intersection connects upto and stuff.
Active Discussion;because there are two differenttimes.
Active Discussion;because there's aÇ-yeah that's what i was trying to
Active Discussion;because they said you know they need to be able to control theinput coming in. okay.
Active Discussion;because they should have two way traffic going betweentwoÇ-way intersections
Active Discussion;because this road is filling up,its queue is filling up, and it needs to drain
Active Discussion;because we canmake the assumption of just two lanes everywhere
Active Discussion;because, i mean, unless we care because given a certain road youcan have different lanes leading up to each intersection, it didn'treally
Active Discussion;becauseasÇ-if this road fills up, it's going to have to know i'm full
Active Discussion;"becausestraight, depending unless you're going to have an explicit rightturn lane, straight is going to have to worry about rights as well;they're in the same queue essentially. i'll just put right there iguess."
Active Discussion;just to get your thoughts.
Active Discussion;so it's interesting becausethe intersection has signals and the intersection has some controlof the signals.
Active Discussion;that's why i'm trying tothink, the lanes aren't necessarily so important as whichintersection does it get you to next
Active Discussion;we could play withthat. because these are the big state changes. yellow has nodifference really
Active Discussion;i guess this four is representing what is required right now
Active Discussion;iím just thinking about the different other possible use cases.
Active Discussion;maybe we donít even need a tool box
Active Discussion;thatís just to kind of make it visually appealing in the map mode.
Active Discussion;we just use this part as a new road and this part as a new road
Active Discussion;because basically i mean, you could basically finish the
Active Discussion;because with the difficulties in the offset itís a bit problematic to draw this
Active Discussion;because for some reason i thought that by clicking the select button and selecting a part i would be able to move this selected part to some other place in the
Active Discussion;because i am not sure whether
Active Discussion;because i have basically forgot what was written
Active Discussion;because then it would be interesting to have like roads with the turning lanes and stuff and see how that affects the flow
Active Discussion;because then you can have a green wave for example
Active Discussion;because there is quite a lot of information we have to present somehow
Active Discussion;because we need a reference point.
Active Discussion;so then i mean if you set the one going up and down, down and up, to be green for 30 seconds, orange for 10 then you know that the other one gonna be red for at least 40 if i remember the numbers i used.
Active Discussion;the last sentence of the fourth point
Active Discussion;it should bepossible to create a busy road or a seldom used one, or any 0variation in between.
Active Discussion;so that'scase one, that's case one. case two would be we've got aleft-êhand turn and we're either yellow or
Active Discussion;, that's the complication that arises when you allowthat, is you have to figure out how it's--
Active Discussion;and as well as the signal.
Active Discussion;and it also corresponds to time
Active Discussion;and so the copsays okay, i try to tick, the intersections says i'm still or thatlight says i'm still green, and let's suppose this guy has rulessaying every four ticks change the colors of the lights.
Active Discussion;and the fact that we can't have a t-êjunction keeps us fromdoing things like that, right
Active Discussion;controls
Active Discussion;directional -- okay. i'm thinking this is a queue, this is aqueue, this a queue.
Active Discussion;evaluation should be, should we say areable to evaluate per intersection or per
Active Discussion;i want to evaluate success of each simulation.
Active Discussion;i'm thinking, yeah, i'm thinking in terms of model-êviewcontroller
Active Discussion;it's almost like you just step up a level and have anobject called a network and that's the thing that assemblesintersection out of roads and knows whether its an exteriorroad or an interior road and all that
Active Discussion;it's coming together though, i think. it's just more rules.
Active Discussion;it's going
Active Discussion;it's not going to work. that's
Active Discussion;it's really a geometric property of the road
Active Discussion;my first inclination is to say, okay the rules if rules can getpushed into the objects and then tick maybe into the--distribute the rules into the network and then at every tickeach aspect, each car gets a tick, each intersection gets atick, each road gets a tick.
Active Discussion;my initial thinking was you'd have intersection object thatcontained four roads they're all incoming roads
Active Discussion;now we're looking at this visually is thisnotion of speed of the car through a particular road
Active Discussion;say some number of cars per minute while the lights green.
Active Discussion;so intersection then we need car, we need the notionof time, this is a simulation of time
Active Discussion;so maybe a drawing of a, the simplest intersection, right, andan intersection, and have a particular road would have -ê it'sdirectional on either side, right. there are some number ofcars flowing on a particular road waiting at an intersection.there is a clock, right, that governs when the lights change.so, there are lights, right. this goes across the street rightthere.
Active Discussion;so the frequency f here is not a global to the network, it's asetting on a particular onramp road.
Active Discussion;so two things: design and interaction
Active Discussion;so we have to have some sort of timer model that
Active Discussion;so, one thing wehaven't talked about is how we in queue a car.
Active Discussion;so, yeah i guess at a very base level we kick everything offwith main( ). right
Active Discussion;somehow we need to represent the amount of trafficor traffic flow
Active Discussion;that's another thing is thelight
Active Discussion;the lane would be an addition of the road with somespecific logic data.
Active Discussion;then what we're really trying to do isminimize the wait time
Active Discussion;this is a queue and what we're reallyinterested in is how those cars queue up, how big the queuesget, when the queues release and how many we can pop-êupthe end of the queue for some given clock tick. then we cankeep speed constant for
Active Discussion;this is starting to sound very--i mean i can already see thelength of the source file for the car
Active Discussion;we have some constraints on the flow of the queuesbecause we can't have lights coming in a collision course.
Active Discussion;we need something that represents intersections.
Active Discussion;we should talk about road, got this modelcontrol
Active Discussion;where you put these roads determines how the queue,the maximum number of cars in an intersection
Active Discussion;and then there's some way to
Active Discussion;but jim did we finish with the cars kind of
Active Discussion;but you know that you brought up a point you know
Active Discussion;i think it's just saying
Active Discussion;i think wehave to talk to professor e again, because she didn't specify themost important aspect of it, which is how do you know thatyour lighting system is working to its best potential? i candraw the map, i can specify all these parameters and now i runit, how do i know this is good
Active Discussion;i think we're going to have to rely on professor e forcreating the details about the theory of how that works. i mean,we might have to code whatever her understanding is of trafficlight theory into it
Active Discussion;i want to do
Active Discussion;i'm thinking
Active Discussion;is there a sensor?'
Active Discussion;it didn't sound like you need control at the individual carlevel
Active Discussion;let's start coding
Active Discussion;like it could be like
Active Discussion;of course we're not going and talking to her, we're going to talkto the team of software developers
Active Discussion;okay, i say i want fifty cars on the grid, but i don't want themall going the same way.
Active Discussion;one thing that we're kind of missing there
Active Discussion;should not allow
Active Discussion;so i would start simple, jim.
Active Discussion;so let's build
Active Discussion;so let's just say for
Active Discussion;so lets say somehow we figure it all out and we'reable to pump traffic through it
Active Discussion;so that'slike a final stage, how do you report the results
Active Discussion;so the form needs to be
Active Discussion;"so what does ""it worked"" mean?"
Active Discussion;t has a computer, i would have to think about it reallyhard.
Active Discussion;talk through this with me
Active Discussion;that it would have tobe like flex or something
Active Discussion;the distances, you know
Active Discussion;the left?hand turns are
Active Discussion;there has to be
Active Discussion;want tostart off and say i have
Active Discussion;we have to be able to describe the behavior of thetraffic lights at each intersection.
Active Discussion;we haven't yet worked thesensors
Active Discussion;we need to collect it as part of the approach to the intersection
Active Discussion;we still have to do thedetail design for how you specify these numbers
Active Discussion;what does ramming mean
Active Discussion;what does that mean? what isthe sensor sensoring? or detecting?
Active Discussion;with or without an optionto
Active Discussion;you can just give it a density andit just follows these rules
Active Discussion;you start simply.
Active Discussion;you're completely just withdrawing the map
Active Discussion;know it stops, it stopsnecessarily adding cars to this road,
Active Discussion;let's see what other
Active Discussion;and it's significant because it holds anumber of cars.
Active Discussion;and then you just have dictate people waiting for that turnare going to pile up as if it was straight
Active Discussion;direction. left, straight
Active Discussion;i could see a situation where you want to justÇ-you have xnumber of cars queued up, you say i'm going to stop this for nowbut you still want that throughÇ-put to go through even though ithasn't necessarily hit this intersection yet
Active Discussion;i'm trying to think from how youwould actually manipulate this
Active Discussion;it just consists of a set of intersectionsconnected
Active Discussion;its going to be significant
Active Discussion;it's kind of a combination of clock and then there's also[inaudible
Active Discussion;it's two lanes, one of them
Active Discussion;sensorÇ-driven
Active Discussion;so how are these signalsÇ-trying to pull out our data
Active Discussion;so we
Active Discussion;sounds like at each individual lane. on top of that,and being able to basically control the amount of cars goingthrough and certain flows in certain areas.
Active Discussion;the left turn really introduces a lot of problems
Active Discussion;the onlything the lanes are really going to affect is...how the lights affectus
Active Discussion;the problem is you can chop up lanes
Active Discussion;the problem with that is the variable path.
Active Discussion;the road would actually own what traffic it expects tobe traveling on it
Active Discussion;the signals. actual signals.
Active Discussion;there'stime,
Active Discussion;they have signals
Active Discussion;traffic
Active Discussion;we don't want to get into
Active Discussion;we just more care about
Active Discussion;we might have multiple inputs and they're all going to have to sayhere's cars coming at you. and at that point the road justbecomes a queue and just keeps on popping on cars, and thenthey keep, they'll just pop off the queue.
Active Discussion;well it's a queue with a limit
Active Discussion;well it's more of a stops. it's more of a stops flow starts flow kindof thing
Active Discussion;i guess should be to have a look at congestion and see how many cars can actually get through during a certain amount of time
Active Discussion;i have traffic density can be changed.
Active Discussion;ah okay, road. we would have roads
Active Discussion;although for roads it would be a bit more tricky because i mean if we zoom in the sign that every road has two intersections, it doesnít fit, because at the edges of the map we have to have something else.
Active Discussion;i donít think that you want to redefine it for each intersection again and again if the timing is the same
Active Discussion;i guess we could do it as a hit map for the road in visualization mode
Active Discussion;i think we should then move to stages sooner or later
Active Discussion;i would like to use the abstraction level we have here at the requirement level
Active Discussion;it is: behavior can be defined at each intersection
Active Discussion;so i guess the visual map is to replay the simulation and the road layout is to create new simulations
Active Discussion;so i would expect some overall either 2-d or 3-d visualization where you can directly create your traffics and then you could push some button on saying simulate and maybe during the simulation at runtime you can also change some parts, like changing the traffic density, velocity or the traffic light behavior.
Active Discussion;so what i would like to have is some kind of traffic library
Active Discussion;speed limit i would say rather
Active Discussion;the first one was for me that we need a visual map
Active Discussion;then the next one was: there are optional sensors for car detection.
Active Discussion;there seems to be two moves
Active Discussion;this is a road. i added a road to the system
Active Discussion;we also need to look at how fast the cars are while crossing each intersection.
Active Discussion;we canít have an open ended intersections or open ended roads.
Active Discussion;we could either now think about some technical aspects meaning for the visualization on the letís say more component diagram level which items do we need or maybe first of all we maybe make a class diagram for the different items, which should be represented by the software referencing to the requirements
Active Discussion;we start with the plane map without any roads and then we can add some.
Active Discussion;you have the speed limit of the roads, but then also the velocity of the cars
Active Discussion;you should hopefully be able to see what the throughput is.
Conversation Management;then the next one was: there are optional sensors for car detection.
Conversation Management;there seems to be two moves
Conversation Management;this is a road. i added a road to the system
Conversation Management;we also need to look at how fast the cars are while crossing each intersection.
Conversation Management;we canít have an open ended intersections or open ended roads.

Conversation Management;you have the speed limit of the roads, but then also the velocity of the cars
Conversation Management;you should hopefully be able to see what the throughput is.
Conversation Management;another question is: which way the user can put a car onto the lane, as then there might be different starting points where cars can
Conversation Management;i mean if you should be able to create like green waves and stuff.
Conversation Management;i mean must still identify it as an intersection
Conversation Management;i think i read it somewhere, letís just assume that it was written somewhere
Conversation Management;letís see, combinations of individual signals should not be
Conversation Management;mean what you could do is just control how long each of them are green and then the other one is gone be red automatically so then you can say ok this one is going to be green for, i donít know, whatís normal, but 20 seconds and this one is going to be green for 30 seconds and then they just go back and forth
Conversation Management;perhaps we could draw some simple examples of what it could look like.
Conversation Management;so the question is how they should interact with the traffic lights, i guess.
Conversation Management;so the question, we gonna have to think about when traffic light are turning orange
Conversation Management;so this should be easy the main question here is i guess
Conversation Management;so we need to find a way to, for the user to describe the behavior
Conversation Management;the question is whether
Conversation Management;the question is whether we could give this to our advantage
Conversation Management;we need to assume some kind of absolute time
Conversation Management;we need to make sure that the traffic light to the right
Conversation Management;we need to make sure that this cannot happen.
Conversation Management;yeah, so maybe we should draw it a little bit bigger, i mean because there is quite a lot of information we have to present somehow.
Conversation Management;yeah, so this should be always be shown on the bottom in this way here.
Conversation Management;ah, i see
Conversation Management;i see
Conversation Management;i see.
Conversation Management;oh, i see what you're saying
Conversation Management;oh, i see what you're saying, uh huh. okay.
Conversation Management;i understand what you mean
Conversation Management;7right?
Conversation Management;a queue of cars.
Conversation Management;a specific car?
Conversation Management;does that seem reasonable?
Conversation Management;goes from blue to orange right?
Conversation Management;i want to basically i want to controlaspects of the intersection
Conversation Management;intersection?
Conversation Management;is that true?3well
Conversation Management;is that what your saying
Conversation Management;okay?
Conversation Management;once again, it's per tick right
Conversation Management;one car per tick
Conversation Management;onramp right?
Conversation Management;pretty simple guy though right
Conversation Management;right
Conversation Management;right.
Conversation Management;right?
Conversation Management;toanalytics right?
Conversation Management;yeah,
Conversation Management;and this is a real?time table?
Conversation Management;are you saying there's actually a car out there
Conversation Management;but not every car that starts at c would do that?
Conversation Management;did it saythat?
Conversation Management;how do you report the final results?
Conversation Management;i'm sorry
Conversation Management;probably need to talk to professor e alittle more about that.
Conversation Management;put it up there.
Conversation Management;so it has four approaches at most?
Conversation Management;so you want to leave one of these constant and change theother.
Conversation Management;this is cars?
Conversation Management;want to draw something?
Conversation Management;what i would do is
Conversation Management;you can buildmultiple simulations on this map
Conversation Management;you know?
Conversation Management;you say, i want 50 cars like this.
Conversation Management;you think?
Conversation Management;do we care?
Conversation Management;do we really want that
Conversation Management;is it safe from stuff like that
Conversation Management;is that really the only thing?
Conversation Management;kind of?
Conversation Management;really
Conversation Management;so can you hit all the green
Conversation Management;this is on the road isn't it
Conversation Management;well?
Conversation Management;does that fit to you view as well?
Conversation Management;a sketch for the interface?
Conversation Management;again sorry for my handwriting
Conversation Management;ah sorry
Conversation Management;but we have the roads.
Conversation Management;did you remove it?
Conversation Management;do you understand my point?
Conversation Management;do you want to do it or should i continue?
Conversation Management;do you want to model as use case?
Conversation Management;have you seen what iím drawing on my side?
Conversation Management;how much time is left? 10.30?
Conversation Management;huh? road traffic?
Conversation Management;i start with a map?
Conversation Management;iím sorry about my handwriting
Conversation Management;is it okay in that state?
Conversation Management;is it okay?
Conversation Management;is my handwriting okay?
Conversation Management;is that big enough?
Conversation Management;is that okay?
Conversation Management;maybe just call it tool box or something like that
Conversation Management;really?
Conversation Management;remove everything
Conversation Management;right? is that correct?
Conversation Management;should i start?
Conversation Management;should we do a drawing for that or
Conversation Management;should we draw it in detail or do we just make a statement on what we have, what needs to be visualized, the roads, the traffic lights and the cars
Conversation Management;sorry
Conversation Management;sorry for my handwriting
Conversation Management;sorry i have
Conversation Management;sorry.
Conversation Management;sorry?
Conversation Management;that will be the timing scheme?
Conversation Management;then i remove the drawings of the roads?
Conversation Management;we could do just a mock up if you like
Conversation Management;what am i doing wrong?
Conversation Management;which is if we go to the visual item and have the map is okay, isnít it?
Conversation Management;why we move the intersection you mean?
Conversation Management;would that be okay?
Conversation Management;you can read it?
Conversation Management;you mean each traffic light?
Conversation Management;you see my line?
Conversation Management;you want me to try? okay
Conversation Management;alright?
Conversation Management;because orange is both, preparing to start, well how does it work, and then it is also hinting that soon it will be red, right?
Conversation Management;but do you mean like this?
Creative Conflict;but they will always be the same, right?
Creative Conflict;can you remember, did the task description say something concerning this
Creative Conflict;did you hear rodi?
Creative Conflict;did you turn of the screen recording?
Creative Conflict;do you get what i mean?
Creative Conflict;i am sorry for this ugly appearance
Creative Conflict;i was thinking if we should have triggers as you said i mean of the signals.
Creative Conflict;is it right?
Creative Conflict;no, no go ahead.
Creative Conflict;ok?
Creative Conflict;or what do you think?
Creative Conflict;perhaps you can do the intersections
Active Discussion;right
Active Discussion;right?
Active Discussion;shall i give it a try?
Active Discussion;should be able to set that one?
Active Discussion;so i am sorry for that
Active Discussion;so we keep that?
Active Discussion;so you mean if the user uses the intersection symbol, then it would automatically create the traffic light in a specific way.
Active Discussion;sorry
Active Discussion;ulation, i mean, letís just assume that, to safe some complicity that we will start with, that we only have this simple intersection and we start the simulation and this car makes this and there is no car, it would actually start with a green fix at this traffic light, right?
Active Discussion;with the sensors or?
Active Discussion;with this slidebar at the bottom, or so something like this
Active Discussion;you know what i mean?
Active Discussion;you mean that user doesnít have to draw it anyway, but that the software would detect it and then say ok, you draw an intersection, i will add traffic lights on my own
Active Discussion;. i guess we can erase these, this now.
Active Discussion;how much longer?
Active Discussion;so that's okay?
Active Discussion;yeah, they're there. there's something about the light, eachlight has some kind of timing settings.
Active Discussion;but then i can also the delete the selected part and not everything.
Active Discussion;do you know this, rodi, do you know that, currently certain parts are selected in purple. is this the selected part for the smartboard?
Active Discussion;ok
Active Discussion;perhaps, rodi, you can answer this question: i would like to select this part on the right hand side, the streets and so and move this to the left hand side. is this possible here?
Active Discussion;rodi, andreas just asked me, or just said to me that i should ask you how long we still have for this, cause i think officially it is more or less over in, i donít know five minutes
Active Discussion;thank you very much
Active Discussion;yeah, thank you
Active Discussion;it's basically, yeah, i mean you can think of, it's aperson
Active Discussion;it's like okay i'vebeen in this state
Active Discussion;got it. alright
Active Discussion;i like that.
Active Discussion;it's the god alright, it's the master controller
Active Discussion;oh, that's right, the speed of simulation
Active Discussion;right, yeah
Active Discussion;that's true, that's true. okay
Active Discussion;well i like what you're saying, i like the idea
Active Discussion;well that's a good point, though,
Active Discussion;well, let's establish the rules
Active Discussion;yeah that sounds more realistic.
Active Discussion;yeah. i like that.
Active Discussion;and it's a very kind of recursive problem
Active Discussion;definitely
Active Discussion;i wouldn't want
Active Discussion;if i move this, how does it change this
Active Discussion;it's nice in the simulation to be able to watch what'sgoing on here
Active Discussion;oh right, so they could be different
Active Discussion;on this map.
Active Discussion;that would be very awkward
Active Discussion;that's true
Active Discussion;that's what i was going to say, yeah
Active Discussion;that's what i was saying
Active Discussion;when jim is present, only jim does the board, as you see hishand?writing, his ability to use markers is remarkable, so noone approaches the board, he's very good.
Active Discussion;yeah that makes sense
Active Discussion;, that makes a lot of sense
Active Discussion;a queue with a limit
Active Discussion;ahh that's brilliant
Active Discussion;because you're right
Active Discussion;cool, cool. sounds good
Active Discussion;cool, i like that
Active Discussion;exactly
Active Discussion;exactly, exactly.
Active Discussion;exactly, yeah exactly.
Active Discussion;excellent, excellent.
Active Discussion;good question.
Active Discussion;i like that. cool.
Active Discussion;interesting
Active Discussion;interesting question
Active Discussion;it does, yeah
Active Discussion;makes sense.
Active Discussion;sure, yeah, yeah.
Active Discussion;that fit, so
Active Discussion;that fit.
Active Discussion;that is a great point
Active Discussion;that makes sense
Active Discussion;that's interesting
Active Discussion;that's the perfect simplification.
Active Discussion;that's what i'm trying to figure out.
Active Discussion;yeah, exactly.
Active Discussion;should make it much easier, youíre right
Active Discussion;alright, yes, sure
Active Discussion;fair enough.
Active Discussion;i think itís a good and great idea
Active Discussion;i think itís a good idea
Active Discussion;same thing here
Active Discussion;so i usually start with a data model, so a class diagram is probably a good idea
Active Discussion;sure.
Active Discussion;thatís a good point
Active Discussion;thatís fine
Active Discussion;we need to do one of the representations meaning thatÖ i mean you are right on the loose ends, i Creative Conflict on that
Active Discussion;yes i Creative Conflict. great
Active Discussion;yes thatís a good idea.
Active Discussion;yes thatís fine.
Active Discussion;yes, for sure
Active Discussion;yes, i think itís a good idea
Creative Conflict;i mean, i am not sure whether it is perhaps done differently in different countries, but i think at least what i am used to is that it would be on the lefthand side
Creative Conflict;i think thatís the most interesting way, to see the individual cars
Creative Conflict;it was written in the requirements, i think, i read it somewhere
Creative Conflict;ok, to visualise it, how busy it is
Creative Conflict;so for instance and the traffic light on the, for the, for this car, that specifies something like 20 seconds green and i donít know, other delays for orange and red and accordingly for the other ones
Creative Conflict;that would be the most fun i think,
Creative Conflict;would be basically that we donít say, after 30 or 50 and then you have to take in account, ok, then does this one go to green and then does this one go to green and then does this one go to green,
Creative Conflict;yeah, thatís a good point
Creative Conflict;and have uml diagram for the class structureof each object's attributes
Creative Conflict;so maybe once we've done that we can thinkabout uml diagrams for our class structures
Creative Conflict;you mean the actual data structures?
Creative Conflict;erdiagram
Creative Conflict;i kind of want to build an er diagram
Creative Conflict;Ö we should have some description on how is the interaction with the system which you could also do via use case,
Creative Conflict;do we also go on some behavioral aspects
Creative Conflict;letís say more component diagram level
Creative Conflict;maybe first of all we maybe make a class diagram
Creative Conflict;maybe we draw this and then we make a component diagram sketch
Creative Conflict;so i usually start with a data model, so a class diagram is probably a good idea
Creative Conflict;some use cases or something like that
Creative Conflict;it should bepossible to create a busy road or a seldom used one, or any 0variation in between.
Creative Conflict;or, at leastde
Creative Conflict;. which would be a horizontalflow or a vertical flow
Creative Conflict;aroad is an interior or we should call it an onramp
Creative Conflict;cop, we'd have kind of a cop object that youcould manipulate certain rule sets. or is that implicit in[inaudible
Creative Conflict;do you want to keep it or do you want to do two queues.
Creative Conflict;is the cop really a model or is that acontroller
Creative Conflict;is this all this sort of master control orwhatever? or should that go into where you push rulesdown to
Creative Conflict;it has a tick, tick, tick, or are we saying that alltick logic methods have a combo
Creative Conflict;it might be, or another alternative
Creative Conflict;now i'm wondering like the rule for changing the lights,we established a rule saying the light, are we going to saylight would change to green, or will only stay red for xamount of time, or is it reversed
Creative Conflict;okayone tick so from two to one, we go to zero
Creative Conflict;one car or two
Creative Conflict;or a left protection
Creative Conflict;or analyzing the average wait time of a given car, right
Creative Conflict;or are all the opposing lanesalways the same state
Creative Conflict;or are we lettingthe video camera capture that description
Creative Conflict;or if
Creative Conflict;or if we
Creative Conflict;or is this inside of a ui
Creative Conflict;or we could even have
Creative Conflict;or yeah i guess speed of cars, rate of incoming cars onthe onramp
Creative Conflict;or you could say
Creative Conflict;or you could start from the outside in and say, well for everyunbounded road,
Creative Conflict;or you've got
Creative Conflict;or, i want to run it on--run a simulation for some amount oftime and evaluate the network
Creative Conflict;or, wait. well that's [inaudible] one cargoes per tick.
Creative Conflict;property of the queue or a property of thecar
Creative Conflict;so we makeroads, right. so one m of intersections and we would haveroad connected to the intersection or the intersection has2paths
Creative Conflict;somenumber of--so it has, think of this as kilometers, or carlengths.
Creative Conflict;this way, or that way
Creative Conflict;ticks per minute, orsecond. okay
Creative Conflict;we could do it that way. either that or we could make roadsdominant and then intersections really just a thing thathappens at road crossings.
Creative Conflict;although
Creative Conflict;although wemight duplicate that down here so that they can keep track ofit
Creative Conflict;and what kind of metrics or ideas does she have aroundsuccess or failure of a given, of a simulation
Creative Conflict;ayout on here well i definitely want itred for this whole period, and definitely red while it's yellow,and then there should be a little bit of an overlap. maybesomething tha
Creative Conflict;but i think
Creative Conflict;but the thing is
Creative Conflict;cars are independent ofintersections i feel
Creative Conflict;each approach has a different light, or we could putthem in pairs where the north and south approaches both havethe same light signals.
Creative Conflict;i'm saying
Creative Conflict;or
Creative Conflict;or maybe allow cycleable defaults
Creative Conflict;or, again we could
Creative Conflict;or, it could be you can drawwhile you're simulating.
Creative Conflict;so maybe that's a separate setting.
Creative Conflict;well, by controlling it at an individual car level you end upcontrolling the flow
Creative Conflict;you have to have green arrow and red arrow
Creative Conflict;do the roads delegate this, or do the intersections delegate all thecommunication
Creative Conflict;does it run on a clock or does
Creative Conflict;is it a push or a pull model with the intersections
Creative Conflict;it's getting down to push or pull
Creative Conflict;mean if you think of, you know desktop or
Creative Conflict;one signal perdirection at each intersection. could be
Creative Conflict;or do we just assume that anything doesn'thaveÇ-
Creative Conflict;or intersection is going tohave to say something. okay, cars can come, and then the roadsare going to have to
Creative Conflict;or is thatÇ-
Creative Conflict;or is this thetime between state changes
Creative Conflict;or, i'mgoing to have a left
Creative Conflict;other option is to make it a full two second lane
Creative Conflict;put them in, or pull them out
Creative Conflict;sense to me or just basically
Creative Conflict;so basically leftor straight depending on the car.
Creative Conflict;you know, or input
Creative Conflict;i mean it could be one or two i guess
Creative Conflict;and then we had the road endpoint which could either be a real endpoint or it could be an intersection
Creative Conflict;and through the road endpoint it has one, two, four, Ö is possible, fourteen is not good
Creative Conflict;and we either have a real intersection or we have an end point
Creative Conflict;do we want to make it easy and just have density as part of the road or do we want to make something more sophisticated in terms of traffic models.
Creative Conflict;i mean another alternative would be to just have something like a default timing which you can change
Creative Conflict;if the traffic model should be completely separate entity here, which relates to the map or if we should just make it easier just make the roads have a simple density.
Creative Conflict;it could be open ended, it could be, i guess anything. a house or something
Creative Conflict;so we have to choose, one of them has to be open ended so to speak.
Creative Conflict;t could be either a real endpoint or an intersection
Creative Conflict;this makes the calculation more complicated, but on the other hand itís something like if we donít want to design or define traffic per road which is one of the tasks or requirements.
Active Discussion;and through the road endpoint it has one, two, four, Ö is possible, fourteen is not good
Active Discussion;and we either have a real intersection or we have an end point
Active Discussion;do we want to make it easy and just have density as part of the road or do we want to make something more sophisticated in terms of traffic models.
Active Discussion;i mean another alternative would be to just have something like a default timing which you can change
Active Discussion;if the traffic model should be completely separate entity here, which relates to the map or if we should just make it easier just make the roads have a simple density.
Active Discussion;it could be open ended, it could be, i guess anything. a house or something
Active Discussion;so we have to choose, one of them has to be open ended so to speak.
Active Discussion;t could be either a real endpoint or an intersection
Active Discussion;this makes the calculation more complicated, but on the other hand itís something like if we donít want to design or define traffic per road which is one of the tasks or requirements.
Active Discussion;and so, or sequences or more than one traffic
Active Discussion;but
Active Discussion;but does the user need to be able to define in our simplified version?
Active Discussion;but thatís what i meant with my circles
Active Discussion;i didnít take it into account that it says that enters the map on a given road, so but then itís probably better to do like this at the start of the road or at the end of the road,
Active Discussion;i mean the easiest way is to just have as you said, timings
Active Discussion;i was just thinking about the other possibility, whether we should design it like this: in an intersection
Active Discussion;itís a simple solution but we could do it some way different like this but then we would probably need some kind of main, i donít know, main traffic light or reference point for the traffic lights so that we know, when will which one start and which one, so i mean
Active Discussion;or do we need this for every intersection?
Active Discussion;or down to up
Active Discussion;or one
Active Discussion;or other shorts what you defined with the circle, letís just say for the safe of complicity, itís like this, so then this one would be green in the beginning and by no car would be in this area, no car would be here, thatís, here we have these two nice cars
Active Discussion;or should you be able to set like, this is car spawn, the car spawn, which spawns cars and this is like a sync where cars disappear.
Active Discussion;perhaps we simplify draw intersections for lazy students
Active Discussion;so either they should be able to use go like 20 seconds red, blablabla blablabla or depending on this senso
Active Discussion;whether you should be able to position this car spawning symbol at the beginning or whether it should be just able to detect this is the beginning of the road
Active Discussion;yeah, of course we could also do it like this
Active Discussion;you have to switch to green or to orange or red
Active Discussion;is itpossible to break that down further
Active Discussion;a few tables
Active Discussion;and have uml diagram for the class structureof each object's attributes
Active Discussion;are all the opposing lanesalways the same state?
Active Discussion;arethere any critically used cases that you want to cover?
Active Discussion;description?
Active Discussion;did we have a constraint of only four roads per intersection?
Active Discussion;do we need a specific light object?
Active Discussion;do we want a reset?
Active Discussion;do we want to have it so that a car can make a turnand then change directions so that they're not always goingright?
Active Discussion;do we want to then annotate
Active Discussion;do wechange the light a lot here? do we flip the state of the lightsdifferently based on the state of the sensor
Active Discussion;do you want to keep it or do you want to do two queues.
Active Discussion;do you want to write ui stories?
Active Discussion;dowe want to have visualization of cars moving along aparticular road in a geometric sense?
Active Discussion;how do we create a network. so yeah, good maybe7node first so this is the intersections,
Active Discussion;how do you...?
Active Discussion;how you resize this thing. is thisthe actual window
Active Discussion;is itcapacity or average--capacity means like8
Active Discussion;is that also something the cop looksat?
Active Discussion;is there, put like connecting, is that
Active Discussion;is this all this sort of master control orwhatever? or should that go into where you push rulesdown to
Active Discussion;now can we do this
Active Discussion;now do we have three states for the light?
Active Discussion;one car or two
Active Discussion;should we define an initial simple intersection, an initialsimple car.
Active Discussion;the light will only staygreen for x amount of time?
Active Discussion;where's the first place to start?
Active Discussion;you've got two left-êturners. currently we've just gotgreen, red, and left. do we want to introduce the yellowwhere the last left-êturner
Active Discussion;are north and south the same?
Active Discussion;by default it either hasor doesn't have a left?hand turn, right?
Active Discussion;constant speed throughout?
Active Discussion;do youmeasure that something worked or didn't
Active Discussion;how do you visualize that?
Active Discussion;howdo you detect that
Active Discussion;like should we make itreally easy for them to set up a whole street's worth of trafficlights, so they're timed in sequence so that it's easy for trafficto flow through, or does that kind of defeat the purpose of theexercise for the students because
Active Discussion;o what would be an easy way to name each leg? so iguess it's likeó
Active Discussion;so we are assuming
Active Discussion;that's the thing, are the speeds to beassumed
Active Discussion;what does that mean
Active Discussion;you know
Active Discussion;you want to?
Active Discussion;does it run on a clock or does it run, you knowhow do you control this flow behavior?
Active Discussion;what does he tell the road object
Active Discussion;Ç-is this time for each one of these
Active Discussion;and is this lengthsignificant to store the number of cars
Active Discussion;and so do cars equaltraffic
Active Discussion;are we saying thoseare equal?
Active Discussion;areroads a significant thing here
Active Discussion;but do we really want to stopthe number of cars it keeps queuing up
Active Discussion;but then do you have to specifyoutput points?
Active Discussion;can we capture that
Active Discussion;do the roads delegate this, or do the intersections delegate all thecommunication
Active Discussion;do we care about you anymore?
Active Discussion;do we want to assume one lane of traffic coming in
Active Discussion;does it matter? direction?
Active Discussion;does thatoccur in the intersection? as a containing data entity? orconceptual entity?
Active Discussion;forthe yellow is consistent. or, is it consistent
Active Discussion;how do you definethe behavior of the traffic
Active Discussion;how do you do the traffic?
Active Discussion;how does thatwork?
Active Discussion;how does thisimpact what we need to model?
Active Discussion;i mean areroads saying, can i go? can i go? or are the intersectionsÇ-shouldthe intersection tell the road, you know, flow you know five cars.
Active Discussion;is itÇ-does it really stop?
Active Discussion;or do we care?
Active Discussion;orÇ-how does this look
Active Discussion;so how do you share that informationacross all the signals.
Active Discussion;so what are the aspects of the speed that are important?
Active Discussion;so what are the properties of traffic
Active Discussion;sodo we want to model that kind of multiÇ-thread of randombehavior? i think so
Active Discussion;thatÇ-is that more of the signals?
Active Discussion;the problem is how do youtell the intersection what road this connects to
Active Discussion;then it's an output?
Active Discussion;what are the properties of this?
Active Discussion;what does the sensor do
Active Discussion;what simplifying assumptions could we make initially and findthose
Active Discussion;whathappens in this model?
Active Discussion;which ones do we want to have
Active Discussion;is there a speed limit of the road or the actual velocity of the car going through the road because that might not be the same
Active Discussion;is there something in addition we want to have
Active Discussion;and how are those most easily calculated?
Active Discussion;did i misinterpret that
Active Discussion;how do we want the relations to be?
Active Discussion;in the middle?
Active Discussion;itís okay if i add density to the traffic?
Active Discussion;one traffic light should have a single intersection, right?
Creative Conflict;or is there something specific which we would like to have on endpoints
Creative Conflict;road endpoint, maybe?
Creative Conflict;shoud i call it single traffic, road traffic , specific traffic,
Creative Conflict;should it be on a bigger level?
Creative Conflict;should it be on a kind of big level or is it sufficient to just have a number of intersections with roads connecting them in terms of class relationships i mean.
Creative Conflict;should we do a drawing for that
Creative Conflict;would that not be a property of the intersection?
Creative Conflict;is there a speed limit of the road or the actual velocity of the car going through the road because that might not be the same
Creative Conflict;is there something in addition we want to have
Creative Conflict;and how are those most easily calculated?
Creative Conflict;did i misinterpret that
Creative Conflict;how do we want the relations to be?
Creative Conflict;in the middle?
Creative Conflict;itís okay if i add density to the traffic?
Creative Conflict;one traffic light should have a single intersection, right?
Creative Conflict;but the question is where we put something to zoom in and out. perhaps in the same way it is done in the whiteboard softwa
Creative Conflict;do we assume that the cars always drive straight ahead or maybe, because otherwise we would need to differentiate between roads that turn to the right, roads that turn to the left, just ahead
Creative Conflict;ow to control the flow.
Creative Conflict;so, ok, what kind of options should we have?
Creative Conflict;what would be the best procedure to start with.
Creative Conflict;but it's not necessarily realistic
Creative Conflict;but the light would then have to
Creative Conflict;but then there's
Creative Conflict;but you know
Creative Conflict;, but whatabout the--how
Creative Conflict;and have uml diagram for the class structureof each object's attributes
Creative Conflict;but
Creative Conflict;but also it'sanalytic data saying okay you're still in this queue
Creative Conflict;but beginning when youjust
Creative Conflict;but i imagine the controller controls that, right, the modelbasically is just the basically cars, the queue of cars, theintersection contains four queues.
Creative Conflict;but i think that would become a bit spaghetti
Creative Conflict;but if you
Creative Conflict;but let's leave observe
Creative Conflict;but not necessarilyall red.
Creative Conflict;but only if
Creative Conflict;but roads
Creative Conflict;but that, but this simulation
Creative Conflict;but the push is really
Creative Conflict;but then let's
Creative Conflict;but then there's horizontal-êleft,vertical-êleft.
Creative Conflict;but then we can
Creative Conflict;but we've
Creative Conflict;but what
Creative Conflict;butthen
Creative Conflict;butwhat's--i'd imagine
Creative Conflict;we've kind of done it here, butit's kind of messy
Creative Conflict;but how
Creative Conflict;but at the same
Creative Conflict;but given what we have we think you can start ona prototype.
Creative Conflict;but ideally you'd want to have an ability for thesystem to self?adjust so that would be like the second stagewhere you go and figure
Creative Conflict;but it's not
Creative Conflict;but then again
Creative Conflict;but there's not a lot of, you
Creative Conflict;buti
Creative Conflict;butthat
Creative Conflict;n red for the remainder, andthen
Creative Conflict;but also at eachintersection you can say this percentage is going to do this forvarying reasons that we don't
Creative Conflict;i see the big picture, but i don't know the intersections
Creative Conflict;but at
Creative Conflict;but do we really want to stopthe number of cars it keeps queuing up
Creative Conflict;but i'm
Creative Conflict;but lengthis
Creative Conflict;but then do you have to specifyoutput points?
Creative Conflict;but then this
Creative Conflict;but we may need to trackÇ-we may need toset up outputs you know
Creative Conflict;but what would the outputs necessarily be of that
Creative Conflict;but, i think
Creative Conflict;butthen there's
Creative Conflict;butthis can be dictated
Creative Conflict;it's just a green but
Creative Conflict;but i mean having a selection is probably makes it
Creative Conflict;but is that?
Creative Conflict;i thought it would be different, but i guess this would also be fine
Creative Conflict;itís not stated there, but we think it would be useful
Creative Conflict;but also for calculating statistics
Creative Conflict;but first maybe we can discuss how to, whatís the best way to define the problem in itself
Creative Conflict;but i assume roads will also be a form of association
Creative Conflict;but i would assume
Creative Conflict;but if you say map is our starting point and everything is connected to this by association or something like that would be fine for me.
Creative Conflict;but itís just the surrounding
Creative Conflict;but maybe first
Creative Conflict;but the overall implementation should be able to work with more roads or less.
Creative Conflict;but then again how would you declare
Creative Conflict;but we want to say if we make a throughput through the system via endpoints we would have traffic on endpoints
Creative Conflict;but why do i want to move the intersection?
Creative Conflict;but why donít we have a traffic model per se?
Creative Conflict;but would traffic class in that case, does it make sense to have the relation to the road itself
Creative Conflict;do we really have an actual intersection as an item or is it just indirectly given if you do an intersection?
Creative Conflict;i asked if that is what you wanted, but it sounds like it was not
Creative Conflict;i donít know how to call it but we can also use it to influence the traffic from outside, which could be something specific
Creative Conflict;itís not specifically defined but the purpose
Creative Conflict;maybe i miss something right now but these are for my feelings the things we could represent in the class model.
Creative Conflict;of course we can represent this here but we should also keep in mind that this could be changed in the future and that we should design the system that is able to change this.
Active Discussion;but itís just the surrounding
Active Discussion;but maybe first
Active Discussion;but the overall implementation should be able to work with more roads or less.
Active Discussion;but then again how would you declare
Active Discussion;but we want to say if we make a throughput through the system via endpoints we would have traffic on endpoints
Active Discussion;but why do i want to move the intersection?
Active Discussion;but why donít we have a traffic model per se?
Active Discussion;but would traffic class in that case, does it make sense to have the relation to the road itself
Active Discussion;do we really have an actual intersection as an item or is it just indirectly given if you do an intersection?
Active Discussion;i asked if that is what you wanted, but it sounds like it was not

Active Discussion;itís not specifically defined but the purpose
Active Discussion;maybe i miss something right now but these are for my feelings the things we could represent in the class model.
Active Discussion;of course we can represent this here but we should also keep in mind that this could be changed in the future and that we should design the system that is able to change this.
Active Discussion;but of course also
Active Discussion;anyway, but that the
Active Discussion;but i donít think it is necessary, but i mean that depends
Active Discussion;but i mean a very easy way, oh but then you have to rename them
Active Discussion;but i think it might not be very handsome for meaning for the
Active Discussion;but if
Active Discussion;but rather focus
Active Discussion;but that they reference each other in some way.
Active Discussion;but then
Active Discussion;but then i mean
Active Discussion;but then i was thinking about how to describe the sequence and
Active Discussion;but we probably also need to take some delay into account
Active Discussion;i donít know
Active Discussion;it's basically, yeah, i mean you can think of, it's aperson
Active Discussion;it's like okay i'vebeen in this state
Active Discussion;got it. alright
Active Discussion;i like that.
Active Discussion;it's the god alright, it's the master controller
Active Discussion;oh, that's right, the speed of simulation
Active Discussion;right, yeah
Active Discussion;that's true, that's true. okay
Active Discussion;well that's a good point, though,
Active Discussion;well, let's establish the rules
Active Discussion;yeah that sounds more realistic.
Active Discussion;yeah. i like that.
Active Discussion;and it's a very kind of recursive problem
Active Discussion;definitely
Active Discussion;i wouldn't want
Active Discussion;if i move this, how does it change this
Active Discussion;it's nice in the simulation to be able to watch what'sgoing on here
Active Discussion;oh right, so they could be different
Active Discussion;on this map.
Active Discussion;that would be very awkward
Active Discussion;that's true
Active Discussion;that's what i was going to say, yeah
Active Discussion;that's what i was saying
Active Discussion;yeah that makes sense
Active Discussion;, that makes a lot of sense
Active Discussion;a queue with a limit
Active Discussion;because you're right
Active Discussion;exactly
Active Discussion;exactly, exactly.
Active Discussion;exactly, yeah exactly.
Active Discussion;interesting question
Active Discussion;it does, yeah
Active Discussion;makes sense.
Active Discussion;right
Active Discussion;sure, yeah, yeah.
Active Discussion;that fit, so
Active Discussion;that fit.
Active Discussion;that makes sense
Active Discussion;that's interesting
Active Discussion;that's the perfect simplification.
Active Discussion;that's what i'm trying to figure out.
Active Discussion;yeah, exactly.
Active Discussion;should make it much easier, youíre right
Active Discussion;alright, yes, sure
Active Discussion;fair enough.
Active Discussion;i think itís a good idea
Active Discussion;same thing here
Active Discussion;so i usually start with a data model, so a class diagram is probably a good idea
Conversation Management;sure.
Conversation Management;thatís fine
Conversation Management;we need to do one of the representations meaning thatÖ i mean you are right on the loose ends, i Creative Conflict on that
Conversation Management;yes thatís fine.
Conversation Management;yes, for sure
Conversation Management;you are right
Conversation Management;should make it much easier, youíre right
Conversation Management;alright, yes, sure
Conversation Management;fair enough.
Conversation Management;i think itís a good idea
Conversation Management;same thing here
Conversation Management;so i usually start with a data model, so a class diagram is probably a good idea
Active Discussion;the cop is looking at well state of thesignal and the some
Active Discussion;crossing roads
Active Discussion;i meant connecting intersections
Active Discussion;inaudible] has a type for a
Active Discussion;it's sayinghow far along are you in your road
Active Discussion;oh right, like a traffic jam
Active Discussion;one car per tic.
Active Discussion;so our onramp, offramp
Active Discussion;speed of simulation
Active Discussion;start, observe, and then we'll put pause
Active Discussion;the next direction of the car.
Active Discussion;traverser of network
Active Discussion;two queues.
Active Discussion;in other words
Active Discussion;in other words it would seem to me that ideally you'dwant to draw this out of the box with all defaults and somedefault settings based on some package
Active Discussion;in other words,
Active Discussion;so if we did 2 minutes, that's 120 seconds. so the entireduration is 120 seconds
Active Discussion;so there's lik
Active Discussion;so, like yousaid, if you click on here and double click on here then there'ssome form that lets you collect the information about thatintersection.
Active Discussion;imean they can't make a left
Active Discussion;kind of a twice [inaudible
Active Discussion;the traffic wants to know.
Active Discussion;there's a time for each of those. tÇ-r, tÇ-yellow, tÇ-green
Active Discussion;howcongested is it?
Active Discussion;is itpossible to break that down further
Active Discussion;a few tables
Active Discussion;and have uml diagram for the class structureof each object's attributes
Active Discussion;and ithas a queue, which of course has push [inaudible]. okay.
Active Discussion;and that would be what?
Active Discussion;are all the opposing lanesalways the same state?
Active Discussion;are they controlling
Active Discussion;arethere any critically used cases that you want to cover?
Active Discussion;description?
Active Discussion;did we have a constraint of only four roads per intersection?
Active Discussion;do we need a specific light object?
Active Discussion;do we want a reset?
Active Discussion;do we want to have it so that a car can make a turnand then change directions so that they're not always goingright?
Active Discussion;do we want to then annotate
Active Discussion;do wechange the light a lot here? do we flip the state of the lightsdifferently based on the state of the sensor
Active Discussion;do you want to keep it or do you want to do two queues.
Active Discussion;do you want to write ui stories?
Active Discussion;does that saygreen, red, and left?
Active Discussion;does the network also split up the roads
Active Discussion;dowe want to have visualization of cars moving along aparticular road in a geometric sense?
Active Discussion;how do icreate an intersection
Active Discussion;how do we create a network. so yeah, good maybe7node first so this is the intersections,
Active Discussion;how do you...?
Active Discussion;how you resize this thing. is thisthe actual window
Active Discussion;is itcapacity or average--capacity means like8
Active Discussion;is itthe same thing?
Active Discussion;is that also something the cop looksat?
Active Discussion;is there, put like connecting, is that
Active Discussion;is this all this sort of master control orwhatever? or should that go into where you push rulesdown to
Active Discussion;it has sensors and, it has the timing, current state, no it hasticks in current state
Active Discussion;now can we do this
Active Discussion;now do we have three states for the light?
Active Discussion;one car or two
Active Discussion;should we define an initial simple intersection, an initialsimple car.
Active Discussion;so they can build on?
Active Discussion;so what basic data structures are we looking at here?
Active Discussion;something?
Active Discussion;the light will only staygreen for x amount of time?
Active Discussion;what elsedo we have
Active Discussion;what would this guy have?
Active Discussion;where does that say off ramp?
Active Discussion;where's the first place to start?
Active Discussion;would that be a property of the queue or a property of thecar?
Active Discussion;you mean the actual data structures?
Active Discussion;you've got two left-êturners. currently we've just gotgreen, red, and left. do we want to introduce the yellowwhere the last left-êturner
Active Discussion;, this would be visible
Active Discussion;and what does that mean?
Active Discussion;and where do you see
Active Discussion;are north and south the same?
Active Discussion;are there other objects?
Active Discussion;because
Active Discussion;because you would have to moveseveral blocks at the same time.
Active Discussion;but does it have only lefthand?
Active Discussion;but what constitutes a well?movingtraffic
Active Discussion;but what does the intersection, what is the purpose of theintersection in life
Active Discussion;by default it either hasor doesn't have a left?hand turn, right?
Active Discussion;constant speed throughout?
Active Discussion;distances, and density relate to it?
Active Discussion;do youmeasure that something worked or didn't
Active Discussion;he second?
Active Discussion;how do you know who's waiting and why
Active Discussion;how do you visualize that?
Active Discussion;howdo you detect that
Active Discussion;i mean how do you visualize this simulation
Active Discussion;like should we make itreally easy for them to set up a whole street's worth of trafficlights, so they're timed in sequence so that it's easy for trafficto flow through, or does that kind of defeat the purpose of theexercise for the students because
Active Discussion;o what would be an easy way to name each leg? so iguess it's likeó
Active Discussion;right
Active Discussion;so we are assuming
Active Discussion;that green is on?
Active Discussion;that's the thing, are the speeds to beassumed
Active Discussion;then, what was the information wehad
Active Discussion;what are the goals, and how are they set
Active Discussion;what does that mean
Active Discussion;what does that mean?
Active Discussion;what else are we going to be drawing?
Active Discussion;where was the part where there was something about waittime
Active Discussion;you know
Active Discussion;you want to?
Active Discussion;does it run on a clock or does it run, you knowhow do you control this flow behavior?
Active Discussion;what does he tell the road object
Active Discussion;Ç-is this time for each one of these
Active Discussion;and is this lengthsignificant to store the number of cars
Active Discussion;and so do cars equaltraffic
Active Discussion;are we saying thoseare equal?
Active Discussion;areroads a significant thing here
Active Discussion;but do we really want to stopthe number of cars it keeps queuing up
Active Discussion;but then do you have to specifyoutput points?
Active Discussion;can we capture that
Active Discussion;do the roads delegate this, or do the intersections delegate all thecommunication
Active Discussion;do we care about you anymore?
Active Discussion;do we want to assume one lane of traffic coming in
Active Discussion;does it matter? direction?
Active Discussion;does it say anything about the number of lanes?
Active Discussion;does thatoccur in the intersection? as a containing data entity? orconceptual entity?
Active Discussion;forthe yellow is consistent. or, is it consistent
Active Discussion;how do we?
Active Discussion;how do you coordinate that between all signals at eachintersection?
Active Discussion;how do you definethe behavior of the traffic
Active Discussion;how do you do the traffic?
Active Discussion;how does thatwork?
Active Discussion;how does thisimpact what we need to model?
Active Discussion;i mean areroads saying, can i go? can i go? or are the intersectionsÇ-shouldthe intersection tell the road, you know, flow you know five cars.
Active Discussion;is it a push or a pull model with the intersections
Active Discussion;is itÇ-does it really stop?
Active Discussion;is there a leftÇ-turn lane, or is it a suicide left?
Active Discussion;or do we care?
Active Discussion;orÇ-how does this look
Active Discussion;so how do you share that informationacross all the signals.
Active Discussion;so howÇ-what is the behavior of the inputs andwould there be any requirements on that?
Active Discussion;so in total?
Active Discussion;so nowcome back up, what big concepts haven't we captured yet
Active Discussion;so what are the aspects of the speed that are important?
Active Discussion;so what are the properties of traffic
Active Discussion;sodo we want to model that kind of multiÇ-thread of randombehavior? i think so
Active Discussion;thatÇ-is that more of the signals?
Active Discussion;that's where i always liketo start. how do you see the code beingÇ-just kind of thestructure of it being broken down?
Active Discussion;the only thing i'm kind of botheredis how do weÇ-how does this guy come into play in all of this?
Active Discussion;the problem is how do youtell the intersection what road this connects to
Active Discussion;the sensors?
Active Discussion;then it's an output?
Active Discussion;what about it?
Active Discussion;what are the properties of this?
Active Discussion;what are we seeing here
Active Discussion;what does the sensor do
Active Discussion;what simplifying assumptions could we make initially and findthose
Active Discussion;whathappens in this model?
Active Discussion;whatproperties of roads we have to worry about
Active Discussion;which ones do we want to have
Active Discussion;would it add a car?
Active Discussion;do we have something in vision
Active Discussion;do you have a better statement?
Active Discussion;is there a speed limit of the road or the actual velocity of the car going through the road because that might not be the same
Active Discussion;is there something in addition we want to have
Active Discussion;ah road density or traffic density?
Active Discussion;and how are those most easily calculated?
Active Discussion;are you writing anything right now?
Active Discussion;by moving the intersection you mean also changing the geometrical appearance of the roads?
Active Discussion;did i misinterpret that
Active Discussion;do we really have an actual intersection as an item or is it just indirectly given if you do an intersection?
Active Discussion;do you have other points regarding what you can design on the map?
Active Discussion;do you have something else?
Active Discussion;do you just want to be able to design the traffic for one of the parts?
Active Discussion;do you want to only be able to design the overall thing, which then would be an issue regarding the traffic
Active Discussion;how do we continue based on that?
Active Discussion;how do we want the relations to be?
Active Discussion;how do you know where one road starts and where one ends?
Active Discussion;i mean what are the types of metrics that we want to have in percent?
Active Discussion;in the middle?
Active Discussion;is a road always that ending at an intersection or is a road like the designer when he starts to design the map, like i did right now?
Active Discussion;is it currently disturbing
Active Discussion;is it mentioned in the task or do you just think it would be useful?
Active Discussion;is it the traffic of the whole system or the traffic of a single road
Active Discussion;is this something which is defined in the task or do you think itís just optional we could add it?
Active Discussion;itís okay if i add density to the traffic?
Active Discussion;okay, so visual map would be houses and the cars travelling on the road and so on?
Active Discussion;one traffic light should have a single intersection, right?
Active Discussion;or is there something specific which we would like to have on endpoints
Active Discussion;road endpoint, maybe?
Active Discussion;shoud i call it single traffic, road traffic , specific traffic,
Active Discussion;should it be on a bigger level?
Active Discussion;should it be on a kind of big level or is it sufficient to just have a number of intersections with roads connecting them in terms of class relationships i mean.
Active Discussion;should we do a drawing for that
Active Discussion;so what was the question?
Active Discussion;so whatís the difference between the visual map and the rad layout
Active Discussion;so you just mean the attributes regarding sensor and the assigned traffic lights and traffic behavior?
Active Discussion;the only thing that is actually set is the density per road what would that view contain?
Active Discussion;the question is what do you want to do as a designer?
Active Discussion;the question is what is a road?
Active Discussion;what do you mean bigger level?
Active Discussion;what do you mean by moving the intersection?
Active Discussion;what do you want to say?
Active Discussion;what is it?
Active Discussion;what is the traffic class actually representing
Active Discussion;what more do we have as part of the intersection?
Active Discussion;what was it
Active Discussion;what was it?
Active Discussion;what was your point?
Active Discussion;what were you thinking?
Active Discussion;where did you write?
Active Discussion;why what? the part i donít get is why we donít have traffic density.
Active Discussion;would that not be a property of the intersection?
Active Discussion;yes, i mean my main point is what would be part of that view?
Active Discussion;yes, so anything else?
Active Discussion;you asked if we have another attribute for intersection?
Active Discussion;you mean attributes describing the geometrical positioning of everything?
Active Discussion;you mean each traffic light?
Conversation Management;what was it?
Conversation Management;what was your point?
Conversation Management;what were you thinking?
Conversation Management;where did you write?
Conversation Management;why what? the part i donít get is why we donít have traffic density.
Conversation Management;would that not be a property of the intersection?
Conversation Management;yes, i mean my main point is what would be part of that view?
Conversation Management;yes, so anything else?
Conversation Management;you asked if we have another attribute for intersection?
Conversation Management;you mean attributes describing the geometrical positioning of everything?
Conversation Management;you mean each traffic light?
Conversation Management;but the question is where we put something to zoom in and out. perhaps in the same way it is done in the whiteboard softwa
Conversation Management;do they have to?
Conversation Management;do we assume that the cars always drive straight ahead or maybe, because otherwise we would need to differentiate between roads that turn to the right, roads that turn to the left, just ahead
Conversation Management;do we have to do something
Conversation Management;in the four?
Conversation Management;is there a certain reason for you drawing this options of like roads or traffic signs to the right hand side of the window?
Conversation Management;is this how they set, did you mean, by adding car symbols?
Conversation Management;ow to control the flow.
Conversation Management;so, ok, what kind of options should we have?
Conversation Management;what do you mean?
Conversation Management;what would be the best procedure to start with.
Conversation Management;which other one
Conversation Management;yeah, which one starts, yeah exactly, which one is triggered first, thatís what you mean?
Conversation Management;yeah, you mean that we somehow connect them?
Conversation Management;you mean the signals of the same intersection
Conversation Management;you wouldnít provide some kind of element to draw intersections immediately but rather focus on drawing streets and then for like crossing streets we then have intersections that should be detected automatically?
Conversation Management;do we care?
Conversation Management;really
Conversation Management;but we have the roads.
Conversation Management;huh? road traffic?
Conversation Management;really?
Conversation Management;sorry
Conversation Management;sorry?
Conversation Management;what am i doing wrong?
Conversation Management;7right?
Conversation Management;a queue of cars.
Conversation Management;a specific car?
Conversation Management;does that seem reasonable?
Conversation Management;goes from blue to orange right?
Conversation Management;intersection?
Conversation Management;is that true?3well
Conversation Management;is that what your saying
Conversation Management;okay?
Conversation Management;once again, it's per tick right
Conversation Management;one car per tick
Conversation Management;onramp right?
Conversation Management;pretty simple guy though right
Conversation Management;right
Conversation Management;right.
Conversation Management;right?
Conversation Management;toanalytics right?
Conversation Management;yeah,
Conversation Management;and this is a real?time table?
Conversation Management;are you saying there's actually a car out there
Conversation Management;but not every car that starts at c would do that?
Conversation Management;did it saythat?
Conversation Management;how do you report the final results?
Conversation Management;so it has four approaches at most?
Conversation Management;so you want to leave one of these constant and change theother.
Conversation Management;this is cars?
Conversation Management;you can buildmultiple simulations on this map
Conversation Management;you know?
Conversation Management;you say, i want 50 cars like this.
Conversation Management;you think?
Conversation Management;do we really want that
Conversation Management;is it safe from stuff like that
Conversation Management;is that really the only thing?
Conversation Management;kind of?
Conversation Management;so can you hit all the green
Conversation Management;this is on the road isn't it
Conversation Management;well?
Conversation Management;does that fit to you view as well?
Conversation Management;a sketch for the interface?
Conversation Management;did you remove it?
Conversation Management;do you understand my point?
Conversation Management;have you seen what iím drawing on my side?
Conversation Management;how much time is left? 10.30?
Conversation Management;is it okay in that state?
Conversation Management;is it okay?
Conversation Management;is my handwriting okay?
Conversation Management;is that big enough?
Conversation Management;is that okay?
Conversation Management;remove everything
Conversation Management;right? is that correct?
Conversation Management;should i start?
Conversation Management;that will be the timing scheme?
Conversation Management;which is if we go to the visual item and have the map is okay, isnít it?
Conversation Management;why we move the intersection you mean?
Conversation Management;would that be okay?
Conversation Management;you can read it?
Conversation Management;you mean each traffic light?
Conversation Management;you see my line?
Conversation Management;you can read it?
Conversation Management;you mean each traffic light?
Conversation Management;you see my line?
Conversation Management;alright?
Conversation Management;because orange is both, preparing to start, well how does it work, and then it is also hinting that soon it will be red, right?
Conversation Management;but do you mean like this?
Conversation Management;but they will always be the same, right?
Conversation Management;can you remember, did the task description say something concerning this
Conversation Management;did you hear rodi?
Conversation Management;did you turn of the screen recording?
Conversation Management;do you get what i mean?
Conversation Management;i was thinking if we should have triggers as you said i mean of the signals.
Conversation Management;is it right?
Conversation Management;ok?
Conversation Management;or what do you think?
Conversation Management;right
Conversation Management;right?
Conversation Management;shall i give it a try?
Conversation Management;should be able to set that one?
Conversation Management;so we keep that?
Conversation Management;so you mean if the user uses the intersection symbol, then it would automatically create the traffic light in a specific way.
Conversation Management;ulation, i mean, letís just assume that, to safe some complicity that we will start with, that we only have this simple intersection and we start the simulation and this car makes this and there is no car, it would actually start with a green fix at this traffic light, right?
Conversation Management;with the sensors or?
Conversation Management;with this slidebar at the bottom, or so something like this
Conversation Management;you know what i mean?
Conversation Management;you mean that user doesnít have to draw it anyway, but that the software would detect it and then say ok, you draw an intersection, i will add traffic lights on my own
Conversation Management;assess the load on an9intersection
Conversation Management;get a little more sophisticated.
Conversation Management;i guess the other thing that would be--the other big piecehere is analytics,
Conversation Management;let's go back to the model6for a second
Conversation Management;maybe we can peg that for the moment and introducethat as we flush this out
Conversation Management;maybe we can use this space.
Conversation Management;okay this is getting morecomplicated
Active Discussion;is it the traffic of the whole system or the traffic of a single road
Active Discussion;is there a speed limit of the road or the actual velocity of the car going through the road because that might not be the same.
Active Discussion;it should also have traffic lights as an association i guess
Active Discussion;it should be four, or actually it should be two.
Active Discussion;itís better that we make an overall abstract statement in the time
Active Discussion;later on we could also have this for the purposes you have described that all the attributes of the car like length or speed could influence the traffic at all.
Active Discussion;maybe i would actually draw traffic as a completely separate entity
Active Discussion;okay, so i put the velocity here.
Active Discussion;one of these is always connected to the road which would be enough.
Active Discussion;one traffic light should have a single intersection, right?
Active Discussion;road was for me another class.
Active Discussion;so here it is an intersection with traffic lights, which are from our understanding four, but letís say in general it could be a star
Active Discussion;so i would add a visual item
Active Discussion;so it could also be that intersection is just an subclass of endpoint
Active Discussion;so this is just internals, maybe we need something more in terms of the visualization.
Active Discussion;the relation between traffic and road like a star, you could have this traffic item in the kind of library and just make it drag and drop to specific roads or endpoints that you can reuse the definition
Active Discussion;the system is working, then additional things will be requested and itís better to have it already separated instead of putting all in one class
Active Discussion;the timing behavior would be something related to traffic lights.
Active Discussion;then we have four of those
Active Discussion;then we have the model, we have the view, but we donít have the controller
Active Discussion;traffic here, traffic lights and then we add the timing behavior
Active Discussion;we are going for a more model-view-controller pattern or something like that maybe we want to separate the visualization
Active Discussion;we donít need a traffic class.
Active Discussion;we have a map, some formal map, we have some formal representation of an intersection.
Active Discussion;what is the traffic class actually representing
Active Discussion;yes i would keep the traffic class also for reuse purposes
Active Discussion;you could also do something like, letís say we have a traffic and this would have the cars with whatever attributes.
Active Discussion;i guess i should put wait time here, capacity here.
Active Discussion;also maybe analyze the load on an intersection for road, fora particular road
Active Discussion;and so, should we say the initial state would be this lightsgreen and this lights green.
Active Discussion;and that also maybe also [inaudible] as the right hand turn
Active Discussion;and then depending on 3what type of car, you queue it up on the lane.
Active Discussion;because i think observegets into the analytics
Active Discussion;but i think that would become a bit spaghetti
Active Discussion;cuz that's something
Active Discussion;here, maybe we should do it a little moreformally
Active Discussion;i guess aspects of parameters of the simulation, really
Active Discussion;i guess in our view that's not always true
Active Discussion;i guess the only last thing isthere are cars that are created by the--cars that are createdessentially by the cop and introduced into onramp roads.and they have certain states, we've said.
Active Discussion;i guess the other thing that would be--the other big piecehere is analytics,
Active Discussion;i think we canassume we have a video camera rolling and we can gothrough the other scenarios
Active Discussion;i'm thinking that would be implicit inthe sense that i drag a road vertical, and i drag a roadhorizontal and the geometric--
Active Discussion;i'm wondering with half an hour left if we need to thinkabout how to--
Active Discussion;it might not even matter so much in that
Active Discussion;it's almost like you need to traffic cop, right, traffic copcontroller
Active Discussion;it's like there's a network kind of as well saying, okaywell we--i have, this line here says for each road in thesimulation do something.
Active Discussion;maybe this is this card, this push notion right now and just ahand wave and have it happening in a global sense
Active Discussion;maybe we randomize the--at a pop and push. wealso then randomize the actual direction of the car.
Active Discussion;now left-êturn is a little more special
Active Discussion;one thing we could simplify is, in order to get--because thismatters
Active Discussion;say start with a model and start with the simplestmodel to get the simplest intersection flowing with cars andtiming
Active Discussion;so i guess then [inaudible] is no pop
Active Discussion;so maybe we should run through some,you know, how pictures will change from one moment oftime to another and think about how the software wouldcreate those pictures maybe.
Active Discussion;so what i'm thinking is maybe there's arandom number generator here that has two inputs of likebasically the probability, right
Active Discussion;so, let's say delta one tic maybe or something
Active Discussion;speed of the car
Active Discussion;the cop, let's do--so it has sort of rules
Active Discussion;there's rules governing if you have two carsgoing into the same road, which goes first per tick,
Active Discussion;those are randomly generated, and maybe thetype of car has a random output
Active Discussion;we could make this pretty simple
Active Discussion;whether it has a sensor, and maybe some logic around--sortof setting in the rules we need some sort of rule editor
Active Discussion;would that be a property of the car onthe current wait time or something like that
Active Discussion;yeah maybe let's start with thenetwork
Active Discussion;yeah we could make it all horizontal and vertical roads soyou start on, off, on, off, intersection,
Active Discussion;we'll say you should getstarted on this much, we need to go and clarify this withprofessor e
Active Discussion;and also
Active Discussion;and it also seems like
Active Discussion;and then we have some way of saying
Active Discussion;but also i think
Active Discussion;deally, thesystem should be able to
Active Discussion;either
Active Discussion;erhaps theres
Active Discussion;i could see in subsequent versions
Active Discussion;i feel likeyou should have to specify only maybe two directions orsomething
Active Discussion;i guess
Active Discussion;i guess that's all.
Active Discussion;i just think
Active Discussion;i like it better down there
Active Discussion;i mean we couldjust say, you know, the distance between 1st street and 2ndstreet is this,
Active Discussion;i think
Active Discussion;i think from the user's perspective
Active Discussion;i think that's an importantpart of it
Active Discussion;i think the intersections just occur.
Active Discussion;i think this
Active Discussion;i think we kind of covered all thethings we wrote up here
Active Discussion;i would go
Active Discussion;i would probably wantto be able to hover and somehow in?place edit
Active Discussion;i would say
Active Discussion;i'll tell you what's going to be interesting is these students,whether there's civil engineers but, you know they're doingcomputer science stuff, so their next step after this is to takethe software that you've been given and program the smartsinto it so that it can do the timing for you automatically.
Active Discussion;i'm entertaining this idea
Active Discussion;i'm still unhappy
Active Discussion;i'mguessing
Active Discussion;it almost seems like
Active Discussion;it also seems
Active Discussion;it does seemlike
Active Discussion;it might
Active Discussion;it might be
Active Discussion;it seems like here,
Active Discussion;ithink
Active Discussion;maybe
Active Discussion;maybe even you could
Active Discussion;maybe just click here
Active Discussion;maybe the way to approach
Active Discussion;maybe theres also
Active Discussion;maybe this is just a learning tool
Active Discussion;next release we'll let them add theirown fancy street names
Active Discussion;o i would take the map drawingas one thing
Active Discussion;okay so then we have a map
Active Discussion;right now i would just leave it
Active Discussion;so i think
Active Discussion;so it could be
Active Discussion;so why don't we start out
Active Discussion;t does seem like it would begood
Active Discussion;then i think
Active Discussion;there might be
Active Discussion;there was something about reducing wait?time and
Active Discussion;think
Active Discussion;think that
Active Discussion;this has to be like the main objec
Active Discussion;we build a flex application
Active Discussion;we could have
Active Discussion;we haven't really,this is where we find some conflict
Active Discussion;you know, in some ways it seems
Active Discussion;you know, we should think about that
Active Discussion;you need some control with the flow
Active Discussion;you'd set a rate
Active Discussion;i think, kind of the we would have to use[inaudible
Active Discussion;i thinkwe just go off the number of signals at each intersection.
Active Discussion;think one thing is that the controls have to modify the signaltimings and the sensors so we basically got to just basically sayhere's
Active Discussion;think that at that point,we don't really care.
Active Discussion;think there's another thing you captured here. there'sthese inputs. and the road can actually have or, you know.
Active Discussion;think we can make that first clean division
Active Discussion;think, is the model on which to build the end userapplication.
Active Discussion;i guess that dependency is really comes back to the signals
Active Discussion;i guess the issues that are going to come into play are
Active Discussion;i think it's a simplification
Active Discussion;i think it's just more consistent
Active Discussion;i think it's more of a collection of signals because
Active Discussion;i think its more of the number of cars in period of time
Active Discussion;i think really we care more about
Active Discussion;i think that these are the only ones that should be toggable
Active Discussion;i think the road's going to have to be a little bit smarter
Active Discussion;i think theintersection's going toÇ-basically its interface is looking at that,its going to say road give me left cars, give me straight cars, giveme right cars
Active Discussion;i think there's aÇ-should be [inaudible] this if not just two fulllanes
Active Discussion;i think they're pretty straightÇ-forwardobjects
Active Discussion;i think those were the main big players
Active Discussion;i think we have
Active Discussion;i'm saying this is probably the best assumption
Active Discussion;it seems like a, for this type of problem a good first attack is justkind of a, you know a data analysis
Active Discussion;so i think one of the things we'recoming out is the roadÇ-i don't know if it has lanes so much as ithas, you know left, straight, right.
Active Discussion;so let's go with the minimum so
Active Discussion;so maybe the data structure is set up where we don'tcare, i don't think we do care
Active Discussion;we can say iÇ-
Active Discussion;we might have to say add left caradd straight car, there might be more to the road i'm starting tothink.
Active Discussion;yeah i'm justÇ-do a flat file, sterilize it all
Active Discussion;you know, the leftcan go at the same time and then.
Active Discussion;i guess there needs to be a timer for
Active Discussion;i think itís useful,
Active Discussion;i think the sensors are on the road rather connecting the intersections rather than on the intersection
Active Discussion;it could be that this is roads specific
Active Discussion;i guess the map can stay there
Active Discussion;i guess there should be some statistics in terms of like the total throughput of the system or something like that. runtime statistics
Active Discussion;i guess timing behavior would be something in relation to traffic lights
Active Discussion;i mean the combination of possible roads would become a combinatorial exploration
Active Discussion;i mean the naÔve way to go about it would just start with a map and then assume that everything is a subset of a map.
Active Discussion;i mean they should contain information like density and optionally it may have speed limits and so on.
Active Discussion;i would say we have a visual item and that could be either road or traffic light or car
Active Discussion;it would be road property i think
Active Discussion;maybe we can also move it. maybe itís possible, i can try
Active Discussion;maybe we just keep this in mind and then itís fine
Active Discussion;maybe we should clarify that and say that there should be one traffic light at each entry point into the intersection
Active Discussion;maybe we should clarify that each entry point into the intersection
Active Discussion;maybe you want to calculate exactly how long it takes for a single car to go from one end to the other end of the map or something like that
Active Discussion;should we also include the velocity, the speed limits of the cars
Active Discussion;to the roads, not the intersections
Active Discussion;we could do such a thing
Active Discussion;we could have some kind of input traffic, but the traffic is already designed per road
Active Discussion;yes maybe road traffic
Active Discussion;yes, how much in detail thatís something we can discuss
Active Discussion;am trying to remember how thatís in real traffic
Active Discussion;at the start of the road you can create new cars or define the number of cars, whether they want to, changing it during the simulation
Active Discussion;but i think we need for, do we need this for one intersection
Active Discussion;but that, yeah, i mean, thatís the thing, they will always work in pairs, it doesnít matter if it is 3 or 1, that have a car, just that itís, i mean north and south, or up and down
Active Discussion;erhaps we have somewhat, five seconds orange, 30 seconds green
Active Discussion;i am thinking maybe we should have that in,
Active Discussion;i donít know, 10 cars per minute, or whatever way you want to define it then itís actually in this, in this certain interval it just produces new cars and shows new cars crossing the traffic lights, something like this
Active Discussion;i guess a common, atleast here in sweden is that the main road is always green if it doesnít detect anything coming from the crossing roads so the big road is always green but when thereís cars coming in from left or right it detects that and then it sets the main road to red so that they can join
Active Discussion;i guess we should have a play button for the simulation and when you hit that one, it starts with the one that is marked
Active Discussion;i mean it would be more fun to have turning
Active Discussion;i mean so every start of a road that has just starting is, i guess an entry point then and then you can set it on these, so here
Active Discussion;i think i would actually, like something like this that you can put some points on this and i donít know, a car spawner or whatever and say click on it and the you say another one, another one, another one so that the user can basically decide, where to put it and create as many cars as he likes to
Active Discussion;i think perhaps we can
Active Discussion;i think the more interesting and the more challenging part is behavior of the traffic lights
Active Discussion;i would like this to be an intersection automatically
Conversation Management;maybe itís enough to set those
Conversation Management;maybe we have a delay where nothing happens and then it just goes through the flow here and when that one is done it jumps to the up and down again, because as you said, up and down and left and right will be the same, right?
Conversation Management;mean depending on how it works, yeah, exactly, so do we have to prevent them to be both, they shouldnít be green at the same time, thatís an obvious one, but could they be orange at the same time but in different phases, one before it turns red and one before it turns green.
Conversation Management;mean the traffic lights look good now, i think
Conversation Management;mean, this one turning red, that one that we were talking about, could trigger the flow in this one
Conversation Management;o maybe it should be, only enters at end of roads somewhere
Conversation Management;ok itís a bad idea to arrange it according to the direction of the lane
Conversation Management;or should we just say here, here you just spawn cars, oh no, another way, here and here and here and here
Conversation Management;so i am thinking, how to represent the sequence because if you have it like that you can have like a box here or somewhere else which says, ok, this sequence is triggered by signal two becoming green.
Conversation Management;so i think perhaps we can just focus on the traffic light and the description of the behavior before we draw anything again
Conversation Management;so i think, whatís possible, correct me if you disCreative Conflict, it might be possible that there is no car on lane 1 and there are cars on lane 3, so just because no cars one lane 1 does mean that you can turn traffic light 2 to green, because if a car is at 3 then there might be an accident by this.
Conversation Management;so in this case it is like in 1 has no, 1 no car and three no car, so you can turn 2 and 4, i donít know, something like this.
Conversation Management;so once again before we can probably, or how is it done? we need to consider those, both traffic lights again so, so this one and this one, another simplified version
Conversation Management;so we do not need to, the user doesnít need to draw a new kind of symbol as similar to the net but itís
Conversation Management;so yo click on it and then you set that
Conversation Management;so, yeah, some way of indicating where it will start
Conversation Management;t they could just cross the traffic lights and also next to them
Conversation Management;that you define it in the user interface if you if you describe the behavior, perhaps like, i donít know. i mean it may just probably not, perhaps not a main for reference
Conversation Management;then letís say that maybe there is a delay before the other starts it sequence being orange and then
Conversation Management;then our system would need to detect this and put, i guess, switch this to, i donít know, orange or, i think itís a problem that you could draw, this problems my draw, something was wrong before, so we would probably need to change this to red light and then this to orange or green and this switching right.
Conversation Management;then you can say that ok this sequence is triggered by this signal turning green for example so when this other turns green then the sequence will go and then you can have
Conversation Management;we could actually draw some kind of car symbol there
Conversation Management;we just have to, like one traffic light at the beginning, something like this. so then we know for sure that the first car can drive up here, so some other car can also for 35 seconds at least.
Conversation Management;we say 45 and then i donít know, maybe we set orange afterwards as well, so this is that one that this, that one we talked about first, the one going down and up, when that one is red, this flow triggers, so it just goes back and forth and then maybe as you said
Conversation Management;yeah, main or start or whatever
Conversation Management;yes, a minimap
Conversation Management;you should be able to say how many cars per or something it should create
Conversation Management;i want to basically i want to controlaspects of the intersection
Conversation Management;probably need to talk to professor e alittle more about that.
Conversation Management;put it up there.
Conversation Management;want to draw something?
Conversation Management;what i would do is
Conversation Management;do you want to do it or should i continue?
Conversation Management;do you want to model as use case?
Conversation Management;i start with a map?
Conversation Management;maybe just call it tool box or something like that
Conversation Management;should we do a drawing for that or
Conversation Management;should we draw it in detail or do we just make a statement on what we have, what needs to be visualized, the roads, the traffic lights and the cars
Conversation Management;then i remove the drawings of the roads?
Conversation Management;we could do just a mock up if you like
Conversation Management;you want me to try? okay
Conversation Management;no, no go ahead.
Conversation Management;perhaps you can do the intersections
Conversation Management;was thinking, up to this point we'vesaid intersections contain the roads
Conversation Management;, it saysstudents must be able to describe the behavior of trafficlights on each of the intersection so that's maybe building uifor this intersection piece where we allow the user to set atime, or set a--
Conversation Management;2c says students should be able to design eachintersection with or without the option of sensors
Conversation Management;a couple more advanced details is there's the left-êhand turn
Conversation Management;by now we select the intersection, you couldgo to the analytics now. there's a coloring of theintersection as it grows and then the specifics of theanalytics
Conversation Management;it does say...here, every intersection on the map must havetraffic signals, all intersections will be four way. there are not-êintersections. nor one-êway roads.
Conversation Management;i've got some ideas around intersections androads
Conversation Management;okay so students should be ableto choose... students should be able to observe any progress4with their map's timing scheme--okay so that comes back toanalytics
Conversation Management;random number generator is controlling push. andthat happens for every tick.
Conversation Management;so it says here students should be able to choose the trafficdensity they're interested in on a given road
Conversation Management;so this is kind of like our cop rules, right
Conversation Management;so tick happens and changes time, cop is watchingtime
Conversation Management;start, pause, reset. then maybe thenext one will be added on to observe
Conversation Management;that's what we'rekind of doing here
Conversation Management;we have some constraints on the flow of
Conversation Management;we have the notion ofqueuing and de-êqueuing
Conversation Management;we need to design the basic structure of the code thatwill be used to implement the system.
Conversation Management;we now have two 1types of car. straight-êthrough guy and left-êturn, right turn,left-êturn.
Conversation Management;well it does say that something that the user couldcontrol
Conversation Management;well it says the student must be able to simulate traffic flowson the map. students should be able to change the trafficdensity that enters the map on a given road.
Conversation Management;what we have in our model so far is intersectionthat has the light
Conversation Management;and it says there is some package that has some understandingof how speeds
Conversation Management;basically we have three differentóthere's editing themap, building the map is one mode. and then there's buildingthe simulation betweenóand we could use the map too
Conversation Management;but we don't have enoughinformation here. there might be packages out there
Conversation Management;didn't get to the sensors at all
Conversation Management;have up to six intersections.
Conversation Management;i told you the streets, intersections,left and right, i told you traffic patterns, you figure out what thelights are.
Conversation Management;it said we can figure that out.
Conversation Management;oh okay, in the idealcase, the amount of time people spend waiting is minimized bythe chosen settings for the given intersection's traffic lights.
Conversation Management;okay we've assigned speeds,we've moved the roads, we draw the roads, inspectintersections and lights, okay
Conversation Management;okay, create visual map, clean up roads and pattern ofchoosing...
Conversation Management;so one is you want to change the layout of the map, two isyou want to change the parameters you gave us in terms ofspeed and timing, right? and three, you want to run it,
Conversation Management;so that's what i'm saying this is very very highlevel, this is kind of go and build a map, but there is so manyvariables here that would be very hard ahead of time to naildown unless you actually started doing it, and it would be avery iterative process, because you change this thing, and thatchanges something that, you know that changes, it's all veryrelated.
Conversation Management;so you have green, red, left?turn, and orange
Conversation Management;that's kind of where this stuff lives
Conversation Management;the students are going to realize at some point i think,its probably part of the exercise is the professor wants them to,is that you really want your sequences on a given street tofollow a given pattern that enables traffic flow withoutspeeding, and to actually manually enter all that information ishuge
Conversation Management;then we got street and density possibly speeds
Conversation Management;well we've got the visual map of the area
Conversation Management;well, i mean so the end users seem to be the students, and theprofessor.
Conversation Management;you can only change lights, youcan't change the streets
Conversation Management;and so after we've set up this design, thisinput has some properties to define with it. just going to be theflow in essentially as you described. and then you hit go,
Conversation Management;and so we think about, termination of, do we get flow out of thissystem, do we think about
Conversation Management;and so, you fire off youknow sticking our toe into dirty details, you fire off thread foreach input thing, and then each thread input is doing add a car ata particular flow
Conversation Management;but this defines in the data structure that we don't care.
Conversation Management;covers most of our entities at least. what's going on. how theyinteract.
Conversation Management;it says we have to have a protected left
Conversation Management;looks like basically two pieces: the interaction andthe code for map that's able to manipulate road systems with awhole bunch of details.
Conversation Management;map going to have intersections. and then the intersections
Conversation Management;number of cars andtravel time
Conversation Management;so it's interesting becausethe intersection has signals and the intersection has some controlof the signals.
Conversation Management;so we have r1, and so r1 is
Conversation Management;so we start the simulation and it's going to start addingcars until it stops, then it's going to pull it see if there's moreroom.
Conversation Management;so we've decided that lanes, maybe not so significant
Conversation Management;so we've gotÇ-these are kind of the physicsthings, and kind of the abstract things we've got
Conversation Management;too much about the lanes themselves.
Conversation Management;we've got traffic, intersections,
Conversation Management;we've got, you know kind of this set ofused cases about leftÇ-turn, straights
Conversation Management;you have two end points.
Conversation Management;and you said it would be good to have traffic also visualized,
Conversation Management;and velocity, yesÖ visualize at one time, light, trafficÖ
Creative Conflict;for now we donít have any traffic, right? we have road density.
Creative Conflict;if you look on the class diagrams we have these intersections and then we have traffic lights and then we have timing behavior.
Creative Conflict;letís check the other requirements. Ö sensors, okay, traffic can be defined at each intersection, yes. i have promised to read my own writing, traffic density per road, yes okay thatís fine. velocity, okay, velocity should be one part of the road traffic
Creative Conflict;letís say in general we already added in blue some additional attributes for the traffic. there could be more in the future, which could be of importance
Creative Conflict;the road layout. so we have the visualization, we have the model, but we donít have talked too much about
Creative Conflict;we have all data model, we have the view, we have the sketch
Creative Conflict;we have talked about the road layout, we have road intersections in four-way but it could be also supporting more in the future, we have traffic lights at the intersections, optional we have the sensor attribute. thatís something we have not drawn again, right? so the sensor attribute is road has sensors, right?
Creative Conflict;and you said it would be good to have traffic also visualized,
Creative Conflict;and velocity, yesÖ visualize at one time, light, trafficÖ
Creative Conflict;because basically are two directions here: up and down or left and right
Creative Conflict;but then we have 2a so they shouldn't be able to set combinations that would result in a crash so that's
Creative Conflict;i think it is written in one of the part two: combinations of individual signals that would result in crashes should not be allowed.
Creative Conflict;i think it says somewhere that all the intersection must have traffic lights and all of them are 4 way so i guess the traffic light arrangement would be the same they will all have.
Creative Conflict;it says students should be able to change the traffic density that enters the map on a given road
Creative Conflict;it says that the light behavior should able to change based on the input from the sensors
Creative Conflict;must be able to design each intersection with or without the option of sensors that detect whether any car are present on a given lane
Creative Conflict;now again it says all interaction, intersections should be four way,
Creative Conflict;ok, so the requirements, the first bullet point i think would be done with this
Creative Conflict;so i think with this we will satisfy the task that a roads should be allowed for both to varying length and place and different arrangements of intersections should be created and it is not restricted to a certain amount of intersections, so this should be fine, i think so
Creative Conflict;we basically provide the user possibility to draw roads and to simplify drawing intersections we would have different kind of symbols so that the user doesnít have to draw nice roads in arrangement properly but there we have an intersection symbol and perhaps we can also provide and additional intersection symbol to be able to differentiate between sensor equipped intersections and none sensor equipped intersections and for the definition of the behavior we have a simplified model which says, ok basically we have two directions like from left to right and right to left, and up and down and down and up, so these are basically behaving in the same way and then the user can define the timing, how long it should be red or orange and green or from red to orange and from green to orange and then there must be some kind of main traffic light so that we know that we start with this one and the other two traffic lights which are affected by this behave accordingly. so for example after 40 seconds or 42 seconds the cars can drive from right to left or left to right and then again after 100 seconds or whatever it switches again and the beginning of a street the user can click in a certain area and if he clicks there he can define a number of cars he wants to spawn in a certain time at a road and the cars would actually be shown with comparatively nice images of cars, comparable to the ones we created like art and yeah i think if an intersection is sensor equipped, that also takes a simplified model into account, like in this case, if it seems, there is no car in 1 and 3 but cars are waiting or entering the sensor zone in 2 or 4 then it could switch the behavior and put the ones on green and the other ones on red so that we avoid having a long period of waiting cars now there are more cars driving, and i am not sure whether i forgot something but, yeah of course we have a play button to start the simulation and the user can zoom in and zoom out and focus on a certain area of the map equivalent to the smartboard software and yeah, i am not sure whether i forgot something.
Creative Conflict;if we control whether certain intersections evenallow a [inaudible
Creative Conflict;i suppose if you just had a list of intersections it goesrandomly too
Creative Conflict;if it's a single lane of traffic, could those left-êturners andstraight-êthrough-êers be queued up in the same queue
Creative Conflict;if that state is this, then the otherstates are going to be
Creative Conflict;if the car at thehead of, well the entrance. i guess
Creative Conflict;if there's a protected left turn thenthese need to be broken up almost.
Creative Conflict;if they have an intersection here and here
Creative Conflict;if this is ourcanvass and that's an onramp and that's an off ramp, youhave a special edge intersection
Creative Conflict;if this road fills up, then even if this is green,this car won't be able to pass
Creative Conflict;if we ever really neededthis
Creative Conflict;if we had some sort of--our network can be representedwith a geometry that's in kind of the window so you canscroll around
Creative Conflict;if we haveintersection then they know about them
Creative Conflict;if we make the capacity of the geometry and youcould sort of simulate a highway or something
Creative Conflict;if we want to
Creative Conflict;if we want to get more sophisticated wecould have sensor logic taking sensor for each in-êroad so thatif say these two are empty then these two just stay greenforever
Creative Conflict;if we were playing the roles ofarchitect, how to communicate it to--so we
Creative Conflict;if you could rearrange the networks to get thatslope, you would have
Creative Conflict;if you double click you can controlthe frequency of the car creation on that road
Creative Conflict;if you gothrough that's fine and then through that's fine.
Creative Conflict;if you have multiple lanesthen you could say the left one is always turning left
Creative Conflict;if you look at a road. it has a queue, right
Creative Conflict;if you say you have to start with anonramp
Creative Conflict;if you're thinking graphically, if this iscapacity and wait time, the capacity is going to be graphedsomething like that
Creative Conflict;if you're visiting anintersection and a road you don't have to be those thingsthere, all that logic is pretty clear there
Creative Conflict;if youwant to take control, i'd have you say
Creative Conflict;ifyou want to make it longer or shorter
Creative Conflict;it depends if there's two lanes or not.
Creative Conflict;it's almost as if you need to always start with an onramp sothat
Creative Conflict;it's not full it would be allowed to
Creative Conflict;let's supposeto you do here to here onramp, off ramp. and so this pointnow we can get an interior, now we've got an interior.
Creative Conflict;let'ssuppose we make it so every ten ticks the lights change.well, it might be that every five ticks, the sensor is triggered,or something like that.
Creative Conflict;maybe ifyou select a car, i mean a road, it allows you to edit
Creative Conflict;numerical decision data. averagewait time, three hours. and i wonder if we want to allowuser control of a clock in the sense that relating the notion ofthis tick time to real time.
Creative Conflict;say if this is the head. sothe speed controls, like for every tick how many spaces a carcan move
Creative Conflict;so let's suppose t onerepresent a delta
Creative Conflict;so then, so suppose, so we're going to have thecars done in one tic right.
Creative Conflict;so, let's suppose we start with, say this picture is t zero.what would, okay so they can't, let's suppose for a momentthat t zero has all the lights about to change, so in the sensethat wherever i just point in time nothing's moving and we'reshowing x point in time where something has moved sort ofbefore and after state.
Creative Conflict;suppose you have even a simulationobject, it has a clock and a network and here's the clock andit tells the clock time
Creative Conflict;thatif a car went from here--so what we'd see right now in ourvisualization is that in queue we see it pop to the front of thequeue
Creative Conflict;there might be an implicitstep in the network to say to keep the network modelconstraints by introducing an intersection if it needs to at ajunction
Creative Conflict;there's rules governing if you have two carsgoing into the same road, which goes first per tick,
Creative Conflict;this road is geometrically shorter, then thisessentially is saying all roads are the same length
Creative Conflict;when i hit theplay button, it kicks the ticks going and now we have all ofour random number generators feeding cars into thenetwork
Creative Conflict;you have an analyticspiece looking in and assessing questions like
Creative Conflict;you're trying to do the yield, you know trying tosimulate the yield rule, right
Creative Conflict;, if you click on here and double click on here then there'ssome form that
Creative Conflict;f south has a green arrow, then
Creative Conflict;if
Creative Conflict;if the speed on this street is25mph, adding relay, how long should it take you to go thisdistance
Creative Conflict;if this is green, then y
Creative Conflict;if we had alittle more time
Creative Conflict;if you want tosimulate it, you have to know
Creative Conflict;then
Creative Conflict;youhave the instance of the car, the car knows where it's going. sothe car comes, and does some sort of hand?shaking with theroad and the road knows it has this
Creative Conflict;if it doesn't have a sensor it just assumes, justignores the poll
Creative Conflict;if we continue the hierarchy of the signals, the rules
Creative Conflict;if you envisioned some sort of[inaudible] package then there'd be sort of this thing you knowthey'd drop a leftÇ-turn signal in there, and a straight signal
Creative Conflict;if you have a light dictating left, it's always goingto be a left turn and straight and more often
Creative Conflict;if it blocks, the queue tells it hey i'mfull, that thread has to stop you know and then it's got to pull it tomake it go again
Creative Conflict;if some carhere is wanting to go straight and this is backed up, they cannot
Creative Conflict;if the queue is empty on the road, don't trigger it green
Creative Conflict;if theres a one way road, so basically there's only one endpoint on this road
Creative Conflict;if theres no traffic
Creative Conflict;if there's no traffic, neverturn it green.
Creative Conflict;if this road fills up, it's going to have to know i'm full, i can'taccept anymore traffic coming down my way.
Creative Conflict;if we just say has the car,and then the rules come in here whether it's sensored or nonsensored.
Creative Conflict;if we make the assumption that we're not going to have so a twolaneroad that turns into a oneÇ-lane road, i think we're fineÇ-
Creative Conflict;if we think about, you know,somebody is going to say start feeding cars in here, and then thisguy has to say hey i'm full, stop
Creative Conflict;if you have one lane, you don't really run intoreality
Creative Conflict;if you're going to get back up here youcould potentially back it up into the next intersection dependingon this length here which is going to
Creative Conflict;if you'renot, if you don't want a sensor, they said they can have withoutsensors, then it's completely time based.
Creative Conflict;if youthink of this as kind of an encapsulated entity then it's not goingto know about this.
Creative Conflict;ifyou have a full lane everywhere in the intersection so everythingfits they're two lanes at that point.
Creative Conflict;mean if you think of, you know desktop or
Creative Conflict;so if an intersection has a sensor, thenÇ-i think is that assimple as this intersection having api with the road calls?
Creative Conflict;this has a length, it never overflows, you know iften, five cars can fit then it's all
Creative Conflict;you follow thepercentage model then we can just calculate what that wouldmean for the entry source of cars coming in.
Creative Conflict;i mean if we view a road that is the whole thing, the whole map, i mean it could have multiple intersections,
Creative Conflict;if later on we have something not just four way but with this t-crossing, then we should easily be able to support this
Creative Conflict;if the map is changing in a way that you add another intersection in between the appearances of roads are recalculated, but this then is a letís say more complex part and you need to copy the attributes and so on so it shouldnít be so difficult
Creative Conflict;if the system is working, then additional things will be requested and itís better to have it already separated instead of putting all in one class
Creative Conflict;if we are going for a more model-view-controller pattern or something like that maybe we want to separate the visualization in some sense
Creative Conflict;if we want to make it more advanced in the future like you said with the more detailed definition of traffic for which kind of cars and so on we already have the right entry
Creative Conflict;if we want to take the five we can make it even easier and say that roads have a single attribute saying density or something like that
Creative Conflict;if you follow the assignment i mean there is specifically mentioned traffic density for the roads, but then it wonít be as easy to calculate something like system throughput or anything like that so it could also be hard to simulate letís say the time it takes for a single car from point a to point b
Creative Conflict;if you move the intersection the road will become longer so i guess the velocity will have a different impact on the total throughput.
Creative Conflict;if you want to evaluate traffic, evaluate the performance of the traffic lights as a system itself
Creative Conflict;mean if you only have one visual element then there is no point for it
Creative Conflict;so if we donít have any traffic model per se we are only talking about how much density there is on a single road
Conversation Management;so then if i add a third road, then i would have this
Conversation Management;i mean if we view a road that is the whole thing, the whole map, i mean it could have multiple intersections,
Conversation Management;if later on we have something not just four way but with this t-crossing, then we should easily be able to support this
Conversation Management;if the map is changing in a way that you add another intersection in between the appearances of roads are recalculated, but this then is a letís say more complex part and you need to copy the attributes and so on so it shouldnít be so difficult
Conversation Management;if the system is working, then additional things will be requested and itís better to have it already separated instead of putting all in one class
Conversation Management;if we are going for a more model-view-controller pattern or something like that maybe we want to separate the visualization in some sense
Conversation Management;if we want to make it more advanced in the future like you said with the more detailed definition of traffic for which kind of cars and so on we already have the right entry
Conversation Management;if we want to take the five we can make it even easier and say that roads have a single attribute saying density or something like that
Conversation Management;if you follow the assignment i mean there is specifically mentioned traffic density for the roads, but then it wonít be as easy to calculate something like system throughput or anything like that so it could also be hard to simulate letís say the time it takes for a single car from point a to point b
Conversation Management;if you move the intersection the road will become longer so i guess the velocity will have a different impact on the total throughput.
Conversation Management;if you want to evaluate traffic, evaluate the performance of the traffic lights as a system itself
Conversation Management;mean if you only have one visual element then there is no point for it
Conversation Management;so if we donít have any traffic model per se we are only talking about how much density there is on a single road
Conversation Management;if it was green before, we have to change
Conversation Management;if we select
Conversation Management;if we, first time when you draw something and then try to play
Conversation Management;meant that if we want to detect it automatically we have to say
Conversation Management;if the user has to use the intersection symbol then we could definitely do it like this
Conversation Management;if you assign like some kind of ids or whatsoever to the traffic light then perhaps one traffic light could reference another traffic light and the theoretically.
Conversation Management;if you draw road here it should, you should be
Conversation Management;if you know it then you can take it into account
Conversation Management;if you set, if you set the one with the arrow, if you set that one to being green 30 seconds then you know that that one the other one is up and down right
Conversation Management;if you will start simulation
Conversation Management;mean if we consider our example, i mean in some way, letís just
Conversation Management;so create a crash if this car would drive here
Conversation Management;so if you can set how long the one that you draw an arrow to if she said this one to 20 seconds green and maybe orange or yellow,
Conversation Management;assess the load on an9intersection
Conversation Management;okay so it says that's up to us
Conversation Management;was thinking, up to this point we'vesaid intersections contain the roads
Conversation Management;, it saysstudents must be able to describe the behavior of trafficlights on each of the intersection so that's maybe building uifor this intersection piece where we allow the user to set atime, or set a--
Conversation Management;2c says students should be able to design eachintersection with or without the option of sensors
Conversation Management;a couple more advanced details is there's the left-êhand turn
Conversation Management;and nowshould we try
Conversation Management;and then come up with progressively--start off with thesimplest user story, and then progressively add user stories3and then maybe have pictures to illustrate how in our systemthose user stories will be achieved
Conversation Management;at least we can go through it right now. a few tables
Conversation Management;by now we select the intersection, you couldgo to the analytics now. there's a coloring of theintersection as it grows and then the specifics of theanalytics
Conversation Management;fifteen minutes into documenting,talking about the engineering design, code structure
Conversation Management;get a little more sophisticated.
Conversation Management;i guess the other thing that would be--the other big piecehere is analytics,
Conversation Management;i guess we should write some of these things down.
Conversation Management;i was thinking we could startwith what we have now and fall on a user story of runningthis simulation now.
Conversation Management;i'm sort of reminded of the fact that we're supposed to allowlights to have sets of rules
Conversation Management;i'm wondering with half an hour left if we need to thinkabout how to--
Conversation Management;it does say...here, every intersection on the map must havetraffic signals, all intersections will be four way. there are not-êintersections. nor one-êway roads.
Conversation Management;i've got some ideas around intersections androads
Conversation Management;let's go back to the model6for a second
Conversation Management;let's sketch a ui
Conversation Management;maybe we can peg that for the moment and introducethat as we flush this out
Conversation Management;maybe we can peg that for the moment and introducethat as we flush this out.
Conversation Management;maybe we can use this space.
Conversation Management;maybe we should start talking about the u
Conversation Management;okay so students should be ableto choose... students should be able to observe any progress4with their map's timing scheme--okay so that comes back toanalytics
Conversation Management;okay this is getting morecomplicated
Conversation Management;one thing i didn't think of is the popping,
Conversation Management;random number generator is controlling push. andthat happens for every tick.
Conversation Management;should we start soon?
Conversation Management;so basic--design a basic structure of code.so to me, that's where we've got the model. the model anda little bit of how controller controls the model.
Conversation Management;so it says here students should be able to choose the trafficdensity they're interested in on a given road
Conversation Management;so should we talk about end [inaudible
Conversation Management;so this is kind of like our cop rules, right
Conversation Management;so tick happens and changes time, cop is watchingtime
Conversation Management;start, pause, reset. then maybe thenext one will be added on to observe
Conversation Management;that's what we'rekind of doing here
Conversation Management;we have some constraints on the flow of
Conversation Management;we have the notion ofqueuing and de-êqueuing
Conversation Management;we need to design the basic structure of the code thatwill be used to implement the system.
Conversation Management;we now have two 1types of car. straight-êthrough guy and left-êturn, right turn,left-êturn.
Conversation Management;well it does say that something that the user couldcontrol
Conversation Management;well it says the student must be able to simulate traffic flowson the map. students should be able to change the trafficdensity that enters the map on a given road.
Conversation Management;well let's stick to the grid
Conversation Management;well now, intersection class
Conversation Management;we'll tackle that when we get there
Conversation Management;well we can write that down
Conversation Management;what we have in our model so far is intersectionthat has the light
Conversation Management;where's the first place to start?
Conversation Management;yeah maybe let's start with thenetwork
Conversation Management;and it says there is some package that has some understandingof how speeds
Conversation Management;basically we have three differentóthere's editing themap, building the map is one mode. and then there's buildingthe simulation betweenóand we could use the map too
Conversation Management;but we don't have enoughinformation here. there might be packages out there
Conversation Management;didn't get to the sensors at all
Conversation Management;does the professor want the students to learn that through trialand error
Conversation Management;goal is that as many cars are moving at any given time asclose to speed limit as possible
Conversation Management;have up to six intersections.
Conversation Management;here
Conversation Management;his is always the point where i'm scared toerase the board. we need to take a picture of that.
Conversation Management;i told you the streets, intersections,left and right, i told you traffic patterns, you figure out what thelights are.
Conversation Management;it said we can figure that out.
Conversation Management;it's kind of like i go back, like what is exactly theoutput, you kno
Conversation Management;it's messier than usual whiteboards.
Conversation Management;letme erase over here. it's this stuff that i'm worried about. it'skind of sketchy.
Conversation Management;lets assume this, lets assume it's inside a city so...
Conversation Management;lets see, lets see
Conversation Management;oh okay, in the idealcase, the amount of time people spend waiting is minimized bythe chosen settings for the given intersection's traffic lights.
Conversation Management;okay we've assigned speeds,we've moved the roads, we draw the roads, inspectintersections and lights, okay
Conversation Management;okay, create visual map, clean up roads and pattern ofchoosing...
Conversation Management;so one is you want to change the layout of the map, two isyou want to change the parameters you gave us in terms ofspeed and timing, right? and three, you want to run it,
Conversation Management;so that's what i'm saying this is very very highlevel, this is kind of go and build a map, but there is so manyvariables here that would be very hard ahead of time to naildown unless you actually started doing it, and it would be avery iterative process, because you change this thing, and thatchanges something that, you know that changes, it's all veryrelated.
Conversation Management;so you have green, red, left?turn, and orange
Conversation Management;summarize the unclaritiesthat we had for professor e
Conversation Management;that's kind of where this stuff lives
Conversation Management;the students are going to realize at some point i think,its probably part of the exercise is the professor wants them to,is that you really want your sequences on a given street tofollow a given pattern that enables traffic flow withoutspeeding, and to actually manually enter all that information ishuge
Conversation Management;then cars
Conversation Management;then we got street and density possibly speeds
Conversation Management;this is something where i'd go back to the customer and tryand figure out
Conversation Management;this is when i pull out my camera
Conversation Management;this is why we need to check with theprofessor again
Conversation Management;well and i can also see how, in either case
Conversation Management;well we've got the visual map of the area
Conversation Management;well, i mean so the end users seem to be the students, and theprofessor.
Conversation Management;well, i was going to leave the arrow out fo
Conversation Management;where are you drawing
Conversation Management;yeah, i feel like this stuff over here
Conversation Management;you can only change lights, youcan't change the streets
Conversation Management;let's see what other data do we pull out
Conversation Management;and since it's a multiÇ-intersection problem
Conversation Management;and so after we've set up this design, thisinput has some properties to define with it. just going to be theflow in essentially as you described. and then you hit go,
Conversation Management;and so we think about, termination of, do we get flow out of thissystem, do we think about
Conversation Management;and so, you fire off youknow sticking our toe into dirty details, you fire off thread foreach input thing, and then each thread input is doing add a car ata particular flow
Conversation Management;but this defines in the data structure that we don't care.
Conversation Management;call it a [inaudible] requirement. cool. let's check for anyother...
Conversation Management;concerned with too much detail before weevenÇ-otherwise we're going to cut stuff out.
Conversation Management;covers most of our entities at least. what's going on. how theyinteract.
Conversation Management;figure out if roads connect tointersections, traffic contains, lets think about containment a littlebit here
Conversation Management;i think we haveÇ-we can probably numerate the rules we'regoing to need too.
Conversation Management;i want to start by hearing your summary of this
Conversation Management;it says we have to have a protected left
Conversation Management;let's dive into that a little bit.
Conversation Management;let's explore that
Conversation Management;lets look for error
Conversation Management;let's put it in there and we'll capture that.
Conversation Management;let's take that oneout
Conversation Management;let'sfocus on kind of
Conversation Management;looks like basically two pieces: the interaction andthe code for map that's able to manipulate road systems with awhole bunch of details.
Conversation Management;map going to have intersections. and then the intersections
Conversation Management;next question
Conversation Management;number of cars andtravel time
Conversation Management;rules for the signals.
Conversation Management;so it's interesting becausethe intersection has signals and the intersection has some controlof the signals.
Conversation Management;so let's hide that detail. [inaudible].
Conversation Management;so nowcome back up, what big concepts haven't we captured yet
Conversation Management;so we have r1, and so r1 is
Conversation Management;so we start the simulation and it's going to start addingcars until it stops, then it's going to pull it see if there's moreroom.
Conversation Management;so we've decided that lanes, maybe not so significant
Conversation Management;so we've gotÇ-these are kind of the physicsthings, and kind of the abstract things we've got
Conversation Management;start twoengineers on the model, one engineer on the ui. get the modelgoing ahead. cool.
Conversation Management;the next step i would do is to
Conversation Management;too much about the lanes themselves.
Conversation Management;we need to think about the big picture
Conversation Management;we should model that
Conversation Management;we've got traffic, intersections,
Conversation Management;we've got, you know kind of this set ofused cases about leftÇ-turn, straights
Conversation Management;you have two end points.
Conversation Management;and you said it would be good to have traffic also visualized,
Conversation Management;guess we are also finished regarding the time, i guess we can stop here.
Conversation Management;i guess we can just restart
Conversation Management;i mean best we have 20 minutes.
Conversation Management;it could be some kind of traffic connected but we can also just leave it for now
Conversation Management;maybe we can remove it afterwards for other discussions?
Conversation Management;say okay we do a different tree on the right side which is just the overall items and these could be specific items which are road.
Conversation Management;should we go lower again and restart from the beginning, i donít think itís too difficult.
Conversation Management;ah okay, we have some time left. thirty minutes, okay
Conversation Management;and velocity, yesÖ visualize at one time, light, trafficÖ
Conversation Management;but i just mark it blue to say we think it would be useful and should we go in this direction but to make a clear difference to what was our initial purpose regarding the requirements
Conversation Management;but i would make a statement like, what is it, zoom out, view and the model ad in between there should be some kind of controller, i put it here.
Conversation Management;but it really relates to exactly how ambitious we are
Conversation Management;but this should be something we keep in mind saying thatÖ maybe i can write it here that this needs to be recalculated
Conversation Management;do we have other items we are currently missing?
Conversation Management;for now we donít have any traffic, right? we have road density.
Conversation Management;how longÖ should we do this to 10.30?
Conversation Management;how much time is left? 10.30?
Conversation Management;i can also do it in blue as it is not part of the requirements.
Conversation Management;i mean letís take your example here. let me draw
Conversation Management;i think, i mean from the mental point of view i mean we are more or less done even if we define the controller and some use cases itís more boiler plate type of things.
Conversation Management;i will draw traffic, traffic light and traffic light behavior in parallel
Conversation Management;i would say itís too much, we donít get this done in time.
Conversation Management;i would take something like blue to highlight something which is currently not directly in the requirements
Conversation Management;if you look on the class diagrams we have these intersections and then we have traffic lights and then we have timing behavior.
Conversation Management;later on we could also have this for the purposes you have described that all the attributes of the car like length or speed could influence the traffic at all.
Conversation Management;letís check the other requirements. Ö sensors, okay, traffic can be defined at each intersection, yes. i have promised to read my own writing, traffic density per road, yes okay thatís fine. velocity, okay, velocity should be one part of the road traffic
Conversation Management;letís say in general we already added in blue some additional attributes for the traffic. there could be more in the future, which could be of importance
Conversation Management;maybe for now itís fine in that way.
Conversation Management;maybe thatís also something that we cannot design right now in time
Conversation Management;maybe we check again the requirements, just go maybe through what we have or if we have everything.
Conversation Management;not that i can think of, maybe we can read the requirements again.
Conversation Management;now we can move it.
Conversation Management;okay then maybe letís check again the requirements
Conversation Management;so itís currently maybe a question how much is really necessary
Conversation Management;so maybe we draw this and then we make a component diagram sketch on saying which items we would put together and thatís it
Conversation Management;so maybe you start to do something and then i will continue that
Conversation Management;suspect we are going to have a lot of use cases, not sure we have the time for that.
Conversation Management;the road layout. so we have the visualization, we have the model, but we donít have talked too much about
Conversation Management;then i will remove it again
Conversation Management;this is also why i would do this in blue meaning this could also be an additional information
Conversation Management;this is where iím thinking about kind of which view we should have on this,
Conversation Management;we have all data model, we have the view, we have the sketch
Conversation Management;we have talked about the road layout, we have road intersections in four-way but it could be also supporting more in the future, we have traffic lights at the intersections, optional we have the sensor attribute. thatís something we have not drawn again, right? so the sensor attribute is road has sensors, right?
Conversation Management;what is the next?
Conversation Management;what was the timing? how much time is left for the design phase? (asking andreas) who?
Conversation Management;yes i would say letís start easy and we can add additional things later on
Conversation Management;ah no, this is not working
Conversation Management;ah, ok, so i donít know why, at least we can both draw
Conversation Management;ah, yes, ok, itís fine, so once again i will also try to draw something, ok?
Conversation Management;and further we figure to, i mean we can delete it afterwards.
Conversation Management;because basically are two directions here: up and down or left and right
Conversation Management;but ok, should we leave the main window as it is. i have it as a paper in my hand
Conversation Management;but then we have 2a so they shouldn't be able to set combinations that would result in a crash so that's
Conversation Management;first of should we both zoom out to the maximum so that we always see everything?
Conversation Management;having sensors in the street.
Conversation Management;i donít think so
Conversation Management;i think it is written in one of the part two: combinations of individual signals that would result in crashes should not be allowed.
Conversation Management;i think it says somewhere that all the intersection must have traffic lights and all of them are 4 way so i guess the traffic light arrangement would be the same they will all have.
Conversation Management;i think thatís everything to be said.
Conversation Management;i think this should be the only issue right now
Conversation Management;i thought i was drawing again, perhaps we need to activate the mouse again
Conversation Management;it says students should be able to change the traffic density that enters the map on a given road
Conversation Management;it says that the light behavior should able to change based on the input from the sensors
Conversation Management;just let me draw something again
Conversation Management;mean first we can assign numbers here to be able to talk about it.
Conversation Management;must be able to design each intersection with or without the option of sensors that detect whether any car are present on a given lane
Conversation Management;now again it says all interaction, intersections should be four way,
Conversation Management;ok
Conversation Management;ok what we are missing right now is the sensor, is there anything else what we are missing right now, despite the sensors?
Conversation Management;ok, finger works
