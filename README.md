A proof-of-concept tool for measuring the distribution of collaborative problem-solving communication dimensions in transcribed conversations.

## Getting Started

In order to get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to you local machine:  
   git clone git@github.com:ProgrammerMarcus/optimal-converse.git
2. Navigate to the repository on your machine:  
   cd repo-name
3. Install the required dependencies using the following command:  
   pip install pandas matplotlib scikit-learn tkinter
4. Run one of the following commands to start one of the programs:  
   python kfold_tri.py OR python kfold.py
5. kfold_tri.py will display a graph showing the predicted and actual values for the three problem-solving communication dimensions Conversation Management, Active Discussion, and Creative Conflict.  
   kfold.py will display a graph showing the predicted and actual values for the problem-solving communication dimensions Conversation Management and Other.
