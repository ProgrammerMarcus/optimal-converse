Conversation Management;a queue of cars, right
Conversation Management;alright
Conversation Management;alright.
Conversation Management;alright. okay
Conversation Management;alright.1
Conversation Management;i believe we can.
Conversation Management;it seems like it
Conversation Management;it's distributed, okay.
Conversation Management;oh, right
Conversation Management;okay
Conversation Management;okay so
Conversation Management;okay,
Conversation Management;okay, alright
Conversation Management;okay, i like that.
Conversation Management;okay, yeah.
Conversation Management;okay.
Conversation Management;right
Conversation Management;right,
Conversation Management;right, and then figure out
Conversation Management;right, right
Conversation Management;right, yeah
Conversation Management;right.
Conversation Management;right. exactly.
Conversation Management;right. okay
Conversation Management;so maybe this is public and this is private in the sensethat you only ever have roads in the network when it's at theintersections because i don't think, i'm trying to
Conversation Management;so they can build on.
Conversation Management;so, controller -ê okay
Conversation Management;sure. sure, so let's establish
Conversation Management;that's right.
Conversation Management;that's true.
Conversation Management;well, that could be, maybe the cop -
Conversation Management;yeah
Conversation Management;yeah and also
Conversation Management;yeah okay
Conversation Management;yeah sure
Conversation Management;yeah there could be two
Conversation Management;yeah,
Conversation Management;yeah, exactly.
Conversation Management;yeah, it's a little messy
Conversation Management;yeah, it's a lot of rules, right.
Conversation Management;yeah, right, right
Conversation Management;yeah, right. right
Conversation Management;yeah, that makes sense
Conversation Management;yeah, that's right.
Conversation Management;yeah, yeah
Conversation Management;yeah.
Conversation Management;you're right, so let's write it
Conversation Management;blocks
Conversation Management;exactly
Conversation Management;exactly,
Conversation Management;exactly, exactly
Conversation Management;exactly, exactly.
Conversation Management;furthermore, like more details.
Conversation Management;i got it, yeah.
Conversation Management;i know,
Conversation Management;i understand
Conversation Management;lets assume this
Conversation Management;no, no
Conversation Management;oh yes
Conversation Management;right, righ
Conversation Management;so i guess roads, intersections
Conversation Management;so i guess you would say that
Conversation Management;that's true
Conversation Management;there's intersections, and streets,
Conversation Management;these are the patterns
Conversation Management;this is a real?time table
Conversation Management;we could do it like that
Conversation Management;ya
Conversation Management;yeah, everyone has a light
Conversation Management;yeah, that's probably enough
Conversation Management;yeah, they're there
Conversation Management;yeah, well...
Conversation Management;yeah, yeah.
Conversation Management;yes
Conversation Management;you go ahead.
Conversation Management;absolutely, yeah
Conversation Management;exactly, so
Conversation Management;exactly, yeah
Conversation Management;exactly, yes,
Conversation Management;gotcha. okay, makes sense
Conversation Management;let's talk about that.
Conversation Management;okay, cool
Conversation Management;okay, cool.
Conversation Management;okay, so
Conversation Management;okay, yeah well that makes sense
Conversation Management;perfect okay
Conversation Management;put this signal here
Conversation Management;right, we don't care
Conversation Management;sensor, and
Conversation Management;well it'sÇ-its going to be significant
Conversation Management;well there's a speed component, yes
Conversation Management;whoever starts using it, yeah.
Conversation Management;yeah exactly.
Conversation Management;yeah i think you're right
Conversation Management;yeah i'm trying to get
Conversation Management;yeah we can do
Conversation Management;yeah, makes sense.
Conversation Management;yeah, that works.
Conversation Management;yeah, that's it
Conversation Management;yeah. i'm pretty sure
Conversation Management;yeah. okay cool
Conversation Management;yep.
Conversation Management;yes, exactly
Conversation Management;endpoint is okay
Conversation Management;fair enough.
Conversation Management;itís alright.
Conversation Management;no
Conversation Management;no itís not
Conversation Management;okay. now i can see something
Conversation Management;so far itís okay.
Conversation Management;sure
Conversation Management;sure,
Conversation Management;sure.
Conversation Management;sure. sure.
Conversation Management;thatís fine
Conversation Management;yea
Conversation Management;yea, yes.
Conversation Management;yes i Creative Conflict
Conversation Management;yes i can read it
Conversation Management;yes i got it. we can do that.
Conversation Management;yes i like that idea
Conversation Management;yes i removed it
Conversation Management;yes itís fine.
Conversation Management;yes okay
Conversation Management;yes okay.
Conversation Management;yes that sounds good
Conversation Management;yes you are right.
Conversation Management;yes you can start.
Conversation Management;yes,
Conversation Management;yes, iím just trying to understand what you are writing.
Conversation Management;yes, itís a property of the intersection
Conversation Management;yes, okay
Conversation Management;yes, sounds good
Conversation Management;yes, sure
Conversation Management;yes, sure i do.
Conversation Management;yes.
Conversation Management;ah, ok
Conversation Management;ah, ok, yeah
Conversation Management;exactly, maybe this should be, i mean.
Conversation Management;exactly, yes
Conversation Management;in the four, yeah
Conversation Management;it seems so
Conversation Management;ok
Conversation Management;ok,
Conversation Management;so i am, yeah exactly,
Conversation Management;so, thatís exactly, i guess we need it for each
Conversation Management;yeah that's what i was thinking about when i said
Conversation Management;yeah yeah
Conversation Management;yeah, exactly
Conversation Management;yeah, exactly,
Conversation Management;yeah, iíll go on
Conversation Management;yeah, thatís fine
Conversation Management;yeah, thatís ok for me
Conversation Management;yeah, thatís right
Conversation Management;yeah, thatís right, thatís in two, requirement 2, part c, i think, yes
Conversation Management;yeah, thatís the thing, so in terms
Conversation Management;yeah, thatís what i am thinking.
Conversation Management;yeah, thatís whatís my first impression
Conversation Management;yeah, this could be a good option
Conversation Management;yeah, yeah, draw
Conversation Management;yeah, yeah, thatís fine for me too
Conversation Management;yep
Conversation Management;yes, ah, ok, right now i can see them
Conversation Management;yes, exactly that was what i was
Conversation Management;yes, exactly, yeah i think thatís the best way
Conversation Management;yes, thatís right
Conversation Management;yes, thatís right, i Creative Conflict, so we should probably draw it bigger so we can include more information in kind of symbols they draw.
Conversation Management;yes, you are connected, yes
Conversation Management;you can draw it
Conversation Management;a queue of cars, right
Conversation Management;alright
Conversation Management;alright.
Conversation Management;alright. okay
Conversation Management;alright.1
Conversation Management;cop, we'd have kind of a cop object that youcould manipulate certain rule sets. or is that implicit in[inaudible
Conversation Management;i believe we can.
Conversation Management;it has a tick and the tick method really then says i thinkwe're going to time this happened, i'm going to go check my[inaudible] and i'm going to kick off, so its like we're sayingthat this is a traverser.
Conversation Management;it seems like it
Conversation Management;it's almost like the intersection has a state
Conversation Management;it's distributed, okay.
Conversation Management;my first inclination is to say, okay the rules if rules can getpushed into the objects and then tick maybe into the--distribute the rules into the network and then at every tickeach aspect, each car gets a tick, each intersection gets atick, each road gets a tick.
Conversation Management;no
Conversation Management;oh, right
Conversation Management;okay
Conversation Management;okay so
Conversation Management;okay,
Conversation Management;okay, alright
Conversation Management;okay, i like that.
Conversation Management;okay, yeah.
Conversation Management;okay.
Conversation Management;random number generator is controlling push. andthat happens for every tick.
Conversation Management;right
Conversation Management;right,
Conversation Management;right, and then figure out
Conversation Management;right, right
Conversation Management;right, yeah
Conversation Management;right.
Conversation Management;right. exactly.
Conversation Management;right. okay
Conversation Management;so maybe this is public and this is private in the sensethat you only ever have roads in the network when it's at theintersections because i don't think, i'm trying to
Conversation Management;so they can build on.
Conversation Management;so, controller -ê okay
Conversation Management;sure. sure, so let's establish
Conversation Management;that's right.
Conversation Management;that's true.
Conversation Management;there might be an implicitstep in the network to say to keep the network modelconstraints by introducing an intersection if it needs to at ajunction
Conversation Management;well that's a good point, though,
Conversation Management;well, that could be, maybe the cop -
Conversation Management;yeah
Conversation Management;yeah and also
Conversation Management;yeah okay
Conversation Management;yeah sure
Conversation Management;yeah there could be two
Conversation Management;yeah,
Conversation Management;yeah, exactly.
Conversation Management;yeah, it's a little messy

Conversation Management;yeah, right, right
Conversation Management;yeah, right. right
Conversation Management;yeah, that makes sense
Conversation Management;yeah, that's right.
Conversation Management;yeah, yeah
Conversation Management;yeah.
Conversation Management;you're right, so let's write it
Conversation Management;blocks
Conversation Management;exactly
Conversation Management;exactly,
Conversation Management;exactly, exactly
Conversation Management;exactly, exactly.
Conversation Management;from when you start it one way until you all the way tothe end to the next light? but it seems like sensors couldimpact that,
Conversation Management;furthermore, like more details.
Conversation Management;i got it, yeah.
Conversation Management;i know,
Conversation Management;i understand
Conversation Management;lets assume this
Conversation Management;no, no
Conversation Management;oh yes

Conversation Management;so i guess you would say that
Conversation Management;that's true
Conversation Management;there's intersections, and streets,
Conversation Management;these are the patterns
Conversation Management;this is a real?time table
Conversation Management;we could do it like that
Conversation Management;ya
Conversation Management;yeah, because that's a huge wrinkle if it's not.
Conversation Management;yeah, everyone has a light
Conversation Management;yeah, that's probably enough
Conversation Management;yeah, they're there
Conversation Management;yeah, well...

Conversation Management;is that okay?
Conversation Management;itís alright.
Conversation Management;no itís not
Conversation Management;okay. now i can see something
Conversation Management;so far itís okay.
Conversation Management;sure
Conversation Management;sure,
Conversation Management;sure.
Conversation Management;sure. sure.
Conversation Management;thanks a lot, thatís a compliment.
Conversation Management;thanks for the time, it was a nice design time so to say.
Conversation Management;thatís fine
Conversation Management;yea
Conversation Management;yea, yes.
Conversation Management;yes i Creative Conflict
Conversation Management;yes i can read it
Conversation Management;yes i got it. we can do that.

Conversation Management;yes, sure
Conversation Management;yes, sure i do.
Conversation Management;yes, you too, thank you very much. it was fun.
Conversation Management;yes.
Conversation Management;ah, ok
Conversation Management;ah, ok, yeah
Conversation Management;exactly, maybe this should be, i mean.
Conversation Management;exactly, yes
Conversation Management;in the four, yeah
Conversation Management;it seems so

Conversation Management;yes, thatís right, i Creative Conflict, so we should probably draw it bigger so we can include more information in kind of symbols they draw.
Conversation Management;yes, you are connected, yes
Conversation Management;you can draw it
Other;i think you're right saying the light knows the state of is therea car there
Other;that's true.
Other;i would somehow separate it too
Other;no
Other;so that's what i was getting at
Other;that's kind of good down here
Other;yeah
Other;yeah, because it has to be adjusted to however fast you canpossibly be going
Other;it think so. yeah, i Creative Conflict.
Other;yeah, because it could you know
Other;i Creative Conflict on that
Other;traffic is not visualized really, and we could also have a visualization of the traffic, could make sense
Other;you are right, based on the current things it doesnít make too much sense that you have this reuse of traffic
Other;exactly
Other;ok, yeah
Other;thatís right, i Creative Conflict, so we should
Other;yeah i mean it would be interesting because then you can create more complex pattern and so, or sequences or more than one traffic light.
Other;yeah so then we should be able to connect them somehow.
Other;yeah, exactly
Other;yeah, exactly, thatís what i mean,
Other;yeah, yeah
Conversation Management;i'm sorry
Conversation Management;again sorry for my handwriting
Conversation Management;ah sorry
Conversation Management;iím sorry about my handwriting
Conversation Management;sorry for my handwriting
Conversation Management;sorry i have
Conversation Management;sorry.
Conversation Management;i am sorry for this ugly appearance
Conversation Management;so i am sorry for that
Conversation Management;sorry
Conversation Management;well that's a good point, though,
Conversation Management;is that okay?
Conversation Management;thanks a lot, thatís a compliment.
Conversation Management;thanks for the time, it was a nice design time so to say.
Conversation Management;yes, you too, thank you very much. it was fun.
Other;but it's not necessarily realistic
Other;but the light would then have to
Other;but then there's
Other;but you know
Other;i don't know
Other;i don't know how to actually structure this
Other;if we control whether certain intersections evenallow a [inaudible
Other;it should bepossible to create a busy road or a seldom used one, or any 0variation in between.
Other;okay so it says that's up to us
Other;or, at leastde
Other;so dowe want to have visualization of cars moving along aparticular road in a geometric sense?
Other;so now the push is not just the random numbergenerator for frequency, but there's also random numbergenerator for zero one for left versus right
Other;wonder if atfirst approximation never [inaudible] in roads.
Other;, but whatabout the--how
Other;. so add road could potentially have, what's theplace you could ever, you did this.
Other;. which would be a horizontalflow or a vertical flow
Other;and have uml diagram for the class structureof each object's attributes
Other;and i wonder
Other;aroad is an interior or we should call it an onramp
Other;but
Other;but also it'sanalytic data saying okay you're still in this queue
Other;but beginning when youjust
Other;but i imagine the controller controls that, right, the modelbasically is just the basically cars, the queue of cars, theintersection contains four queues.
Other;but i think that would become a bit spaghetti
Other;but if you
Other;but let's leave observe
Other;but not necessarilyall red.
Other;but only if
Other;but roads
Other;but should readily accommodate six intersections--okayso we can actually accommodate [inaudible] larger
Other;but that, but this simulation
Other;but the push is really
Other;but then let's
Other;but then there's horizontal-êleft,vertical-êleft.
Other;but then we can
Other;but we've
Other;but what
Other;butthen
Other;butwhat's--i'd imagine
Other;cop, we'd have kind of a cop object that youcould manipulate certain rule sets. or is that implicit in[inaudible
Other;create a road there's no intersection, so road existsoutside of the intersection
Other;do you want to keep it or do you want to do two queues.
Other;i don't know if this isany better
Other;i mean i'm wondering could youadd
Other;i suppose if you just had a list of intersections it goesrandomly too
Other;i think you're right saying the light knows the state of is therea car there
Other;i wonder if
Other;if it's a single lane of traffic, could those left-êturners andstraight-êthrough-êers be queued up in the same queue
Other;if that state is this, then the otherstates are going to be
Other;if the car at thehead of, well the entrance. i guess
Other;if there's a protected left turn thenthese need to be broken up almost.
Other;if they have an intersection here and here
Other;if this is ourcanvass and that's an onramp and that's an off ramp, youhave a special edge intersection
Other;if this road fills up, then even if this is green,this car won't be able to pass
Other;if we ever really neededthis
Other;if we had some sort of--our network can be representedwith a geometry that's in kind of the window so you canscroll around
Other;if we haveintersection then they know about them
Other;if we make the capacity of the geometry and youcould sort of simulate a highway or something
Other;if we want to
Other;if we want to get more sophisticated wecould have sensor logic taking sensor for each in-êroad so thatif say these two are empty then these two just stay greenforever
Other;if we were playing the roles ofarchitect, how to communicate it to--so we
Other;if you could rearrange the networks to get thatslope, you would have
Other;if you double click you can controlthe frequency of the car creation on that road
Other;if you gothrough that's fine and then through that's fine.
Other;if you have multiple lanesthen you could say the left one is always turning left
Other;if you look at a road. it has a queue, right
Other;if you say you have to start with anonramp
Other;if you're thinking graphically, if this iscapacity and wait time, the capacity is going to be graphedsomething like that
Other;if you're visiting anintersection and a road you don't have to be those thingsthere, all that logic is pretty clear there
Other;if youwant to take control, i'd have you say
Other;ifyou want to make it longer or shorter
Other;i'm notquite sure
Other;is the cop really a model or is that acontroller
Other;is this all this sort of master control orwhatever? or should that go into where you push rulesdown to
Other;it depends if there's two lanes or not.
Other;it has a tick, tick, tick, or are we saying that alltick logic methods have a combo
Other;it might be, or another alternative
Other;it would have multiple lanes so thatin a sense it has multiple queues
Other;it's almost as if you need to always start with an onramp sothat
Other;it's not full it would be allowed to
Other;just wonder if maybe the important
Other;let's supposeto you do here to here onramp, off ramp. and so this pointnow we can get an interior, now we've got an interior.
Other;let'ssuppose we make it so every ten ticks the lights change.well, it might be that every five ticks, the sensor is triggered,or something like that.
Other;like so that you've got this intersection next to thisintersection and if this road fills up, then even
Other;maybe ifyou select a car, i mean a road, it allows you to edit
Other;now i'm wondering like the rule for changing the lights,we established a rule saying the light, are we going to saylight would change to green, or will only stay red for xamount of time, or is it reversed
Other;numerical decision data. averagewait time, three hours. and i wonder if we want to allowuser control of a clock in the sense that relating the notion ofthis tick time to real time.
Other;okayone tick so from two to one, we go to zero
Other;one car or two
Other;or a left protection
Other;or analyzing the average wait time of a given car, right
Other;or are all the opposing lanesalways the same state
Other;or are we lettingthe video camera capture that description
Other;or if
Other;or if we
Other;or is this inside of a ui
Other;or we could even have
Other;or yeah i guess speed of cars, rate of incoming cars onthe onramp
Other;or you could say
Other;or you could start from the outside in and say, well for everyunbounded road,
Other;or you've got
Other;or, i want to run it on--run a simulation for some amount oftime and evaluate the network
Other;or, wait. well that's [inaudible] one cargoes per tick.
Other;property of the queue or a property of thecar
Other;right so this is now a ui piece and the dot, brings up youreditor with frequency of, your frequency value
Other;say if this is the head. sothe speed controls, like for every tick how many spaces a carcan move
Other;so
Other;so all these lines of
Other;so clock is a controller
Other;so do you want
Other;so for every tick, the analytics guy does asweep, collecting statistical data about the state of each tick
Other;so foreach road in the simulation we look at the car at the head ofthe queue
Other;so get rid of this
Other;so highlight
Other;so i
Other;so i can see traffic flow across it.
Other;so i think that might bethe best way to communicate interaction design.
Other;so i think that's
Other;so i was thinking
Other;so if the
Other;so i'll use a soliddot to mean ownership and then an open dot to meanreferencing. so the network owns the roads, the networkowns the intersections but the intersection can referencethese in and out roads. alright, so i guess we need, addroad
Other;so i'm thinking maybe
Other;so instead of just a straight
Other;so is there someone looking at the networksaying the average congestion is, or the average wait time ofa car is,
Other;so it might be thatthe road has some number of, an ordered list of cars that aremoving along the road and only when they get to the end ofthe road do they get pushed into the queue.
Other;so it should
Other;so it's a visit
Other;so it's got to be just a grid likethat. that's fine.
Other;so it's like8you're inferring intersection at crossings.
Other;so it's saying at each tick we see where the problems occurand maybe make a road blink red if it's full and
Other;so i've got two car lengths
Other;so let's
Other;so let's suppose t onerepresent a delta
Other;so max cars, holds n.1
Other;so maybe
Other;so maybe it'sreally a function of the result of how the intersections arelaid out. and the relationship between the intersection. 8
Other;so maybe this is public and this is private in the sensethat you only ever have roads in the network when it's at theintersections because i don't think, i'm trying to
Other;so maybe we
Other;so mostly straight and sometimes
Other;so next userstory
Other;so that comes back toanalytics right?
Other;so that kind of comes into car
Other;so that thisintersection is connected to this one, or is that
Other;so that would
Other;so that you
Other;so that's just the function or the property on thelight
Other;so that's one thing, and also like how longthese signals stay green
Other;so that's the basic way to kick it all off i guess
Other;so the cop as,
Other;so the empty network is what we started outwith a blank page, as they drag a road on, that instantiates aroad object
Other;so the only other way youcan get through
Other;so the pop
Other;so the random number
Other;so then you drag
Other;so then, so suppose, so we're going to have thecars done in one tic right.
Other;so therandom
Other;so there needs to be some logic about, wellthat's interesting so there's a notion of the road in, road out.
Other;so there's through here, off ramp and onramp right
Other;so this is interesting, so now should allow for roads of anylength to be placed
Other;so this network or graph hasadditional constraints.
Other;so this one piece of state we haven't captured is whether aroad is an interior or we should call it an onramp
Other;so this whole thing we should talk about road, got this modelcontrol or
Other;so we
Other;so we almost don't need a--well, we need car to havesomething in the queue
Other;so we could come
Other;so we makeroads, right. so one m of intersections and we would haveroad connected to the intersection or the intersection has2paths
Other;so we need to communicate the interaction
Other;so we want to, you know, does thishappen basically.
Other;so wecould introduce a notion of speed into our queue
Other;so we're
Other;so we're getting some credit collection of rules here
Other;so we've created a basic [inaudible] for it to run in.
Other;so we've got a great
Other;so when it comes
Other;so where you
Other;so you can't
Other;so you click an
Other;so you have a consistent road network.
Other;so you have to explain
Other;so you want the
Other;so youcould simplify
Other;so you're
Other;so you're just doing it
Other;so, go ahead
Other;so, let's suppose we start with, say this picture is t zero.what would, okay so they can't, let's suppose for a momentthat t zero has all the lights about to change, so in the sensethat wherever i just point in time nothing's moving and we'reshowing x point in time where something has moved sort ofbefore and after state.
Other;so, something happens as an external controller is ticking themodel
Other;sodoes it have a sensor, yes, no
Other;somenumber of--so it has, think of this as kilometers, or carlengths.
Other;sothat we
Other;sothis can be bigger than the window so scrolling, stuff likethat
Other;suppose you have even a simulationobject, it has a clock and a network and here's the clock andit tells the clock time
Other;thatif a car went from here--so what we'd see right now in ourvisualization is that in queue we see it pop to the front of thequeue
Other;that's true.
Other;then this guy would have a state. it's like okay i'vebeen in this state for two ticks, go to three don't change, goto four change, something like that. right, so this guy has anotion of the state of the light but also time and currentstate, right. so, the clock ticks, the cop says look at whatlights are green, one tick means one car goes through so wepop off the end of the queue, we say the cop notices the endof the intersection has been in this state for one tick so nochange needs to be made. and then we get the same greenstate
Other;there might be an implicitstep in the network to say to keep the network modelconstraints by introducing an intersection if it needs to at ajunction
Other;there's rules governing if you have two carsgoing into the same road, which goes first per tick,
Other;this road is geometrically shorter, then thisessentially is saying all roads are the same length
Other;this way, or that way
Other;ticks per minute, orsecond. okay
Other;we could do it that way. either that or we could make roadsdominant and then intersections really just a thing thathappens at road crossings.
Other;well, i don't know
Other;we're prettyconstrained in what we draw geometrically so it almostseems like it might be nice to [inaudible] the geometry fromthe simulation
Other;we've kind of done it here, butit's kind of messy
Other;when i hit theplay button, it kicks the ticks going and now we have all ofour random number generators feeding cars into thenetwork
Other;you have an analyticspiece looking in and assessing questions like
Other;you're trying to do the yield, you know trying tosimulate the yield rule, right
Other;but how
Other;so once the car exists
Other;, if you click on here and double click on here then there'ssome form that
Other;although
Other;although wemight duplicate that down here so that they can keep track ofit
Other;and what kind of metrics or ideas does she have aroundsuccess or failure of a given, of a simulation
Other;ayout on here well i definitely want itred for this whole period, and definitely red while it's yellow,and then there should be a little bit of an overlap. maybesomething tha
Other;but at the same
Other;but given what we have we think you can start ona prototype.
Other;but i think
Other;but ideally you'd want to have an ability for thesystem to self?adjust so that would be like the second stagewhere you go and figure
Other;but it's not
Other;but the thing is
Other;but then again
Other;but there's not a lot of, you
Other;buti
Other;butthat
Other;cars are independent ofintersections i feel
Other;each approach has a different light, or we could putthem in pairs where the north and south approaches both havethe same light signals.
Other;f south has a green arrow, then
Other;i almost wonder if, i don't know.
Other;i don't know how sensors work.
Other;i don't know if professor e really wants that level ofdetail
Other;i don't know if they can set thespeeds
Other;i don't know if you can changethese as well while you're going.
Other;i don't know if. but youalready got this on there,
Other;i don't know so much
Other;i don't know,
Other;i don't know.
Other;i don't knowthat almost feels like
Other;i don'tknow
Other;i don'tknow exactly how to capture this
Other;i would somehow separate it too
Other;if
Other;if the speed on this street is25mph, adding relay, how long should it take you to go thisdistance
Other;if this is green, then y
Other;if we had alittle more time
Other;if you want tosimulate it, you have to know
Other;i'm not reallysure
Other;i'm not sure.
Other;i'm saying
Other;i'm still thinking
Other;is part of the intersection
Other;it'd have to be in 60 because you'd only get [inaudible] onthe green, [inaudible] on the red
Other;know there is an overlap when both of them are red,because people run yellow lights, and they run red lights at theend so you'd get a collision
Other;meaninglittle dots are moving, showing you how the traffic is flowing
Other;n red for the remainder, andthen
Other;no
Other;now i don't know
Other;o
Other;oh that's not going to quite work.
Other;okay, so that's another thing we want to be able to specify indrawing.
Other;or
Other;or did i readsomething there that said it has some
Other;or maybe allow cycleable defaults
Other;or, again we could
Other;or, it could be you can drawwhile you're simulating.
Other;so i think it'sa little confusing.
Other;so it would be 50 seconds
Other;so it's almost lik
Other;so it's like a drawing tool that can allow them to lay downthese intersections
Other;so maybe that's a separate setting.
Other;so one thing is
Other;so that's what i was getting at
Other;so the
Other;so the intersection
Other;so the traffic pattern
Other;so then it's divided pretty much between green and...
Other;so then this would be intersection b2.
Other;so there is a finite number
Other;so this can get fairly complex very fast because you have allthese intersections
Other;so we don't need to really place traffic lights,
Other;so you couldn't
Other;so you're going to have
Other;that's kind of good down here
Other;then
Other;there's kind of a drawing area here
Other;this is where we still have a little doubt
Other;well, by controlling it at an individual car level you end upcontrolling the flow
Other;well, so one little thing besides laying out the roads. weneed some kind of visualization of the map
Other;yeah
Other;yeah, because it has to be adjusted to however fast you canpossibly be going
Other;you have to have green arrow and red arrow
Other;youhave the instance of the car, the car knows where it's going. sothe car comes, and does some sort of hand?shaking with theroad and the road knows it has this
Other;but also at eachintersection you can say this percentage is going to do this forvarying reasons that we don't
Other;i see the big picture, but i don't know the intersections
Other;if it doesn't have a sensor it just assumes, justignores the poll
Other;if we continue the hierarchy of the signals, the rules
Other;if you envisioned some sort of[inaudible] package then there'd be sort of this thing you knowthey'd drop a leftÇ-turn signal in there, and a straight signal
Other;if you have a light dictating left, it's always goingto be a left turn and straight and more often
Other;so this is the left turnlane
Other;, i'm not sure
Other;. and so you find this flow which islike,
Other;actually i [inaudible] should either.
Other;actually it doesn't require them to save it actually.so theoretically it's all good memory.
Other;and so can you hit
Other;and so instead of going from intersection
Other;and so this guy has this loop, this do sim loop,and these are kind of the drivers of the system
Other;and so we think about, termination of, do we get flow out of thissystem, do we think about
Other;basically this needs tomodel a set of use cases.
Other;but at
Other;but do we really want to stopthe number of cars it keeps queuing up
Other;but i don't know
Other;but i'm
Other;but lengthis
Other;but then do you have to specifyoutput points?
Other;but then this
Other;but we may need to trackÇ-we may need toset up outputs you know
Other;but what would the outputs necessarily be of that
Other;but, i think
Other;butthen there's
Other;butthis can be dictated
Other;do the roads delegate this, or do the intersections delegate all thecommunication
Other;does it run on a clock or does
Other;i don't [inaudible] into it.
Other;i don't think we need to make assumption of lanes, period
Other;if it blocks, the queue tells it hey i'mfull, that thread has to stop you know and then it's got to pull it tomake it go again
Other;if some carhere is wanting to go straight and this is backed up, they cannot
Other;if the queue is empty on the road, don't trigger it green
Other;if theres a one way road, so basically there's only one endpoint on this road
Other;if theres no traffic
Other;if there's no traffic, neverturn it green.
Other;if this road fills up, it's going to have to know i'm full, i can'taccept anymore traffic coming down my way.
Other;if we just say has the car,and then the rules come in here whether it's sensored or nonsensored.
Other;if we make the assumption that we're not going to have so a twolaneroad that turns into a oneÇ-lane road, i think we're fineÇ-
Other;if we think about, you know,somebody is going to say start feeding cars in here, and then thisguy has to say hey i'm full, stop
Other;if you have one lane, you don't really run intoreality
Other;if you're going to get back up here youcould potentially back it up into the next intersection dependingon this length here which is going to
Other;if you'renot, if you don't want a sensor, they said they can have withoutsensors, then it's completely time based.
Other;if youthink of this as kind of an encapsulated entity then it's not goingto know about this.
Other;ifyou have a full lane everywhere in the intersection so everythingfits they're two lanes at that point.
Other;i'm not sure
Other;i'm still wondering about the leftÇ-turn lane.
Other;is it a push or a pull model with the intersections
Other;it think so. yeah, i Creative Conflict.
Other;it's getting down to push or pull
Other;it's just a green but
Other;mean if you think of, you know desktop or
Other;one signal perdirection at each intersection. could be
Other;or do we just assume that anything doesn'thaveÇ-
Other;or intersection is going tohave to say something. okay, cars can come, and then the roadsare going to have to
Other;or is thatÇ-
Other;or is this thetime between state changes
Other;or, i'mgoing to have a left
Other;other option is to make it a full two second lane
Other;put them in, or pull them out
Other;sense to me or just basically
Other;so a lane has a signal, you know just kind of abstract.
Other;so basically each entry into the intersection there's going to be nnumber of signals
Other;so basically intersection is going to say to this road, you know r1,r2, r3, r4
Other;so basically leftor straight depending on the car.
Other;so basically there would be a queue
Other;so basically we need an option to say
Other;so each road is going
Other;so how are these signals
Other;so howÇ-what is the behavior of the inputs andwould there be any requirements on that?
Other;so i have a leftÇ-turn lane
Other;so i mean at that
Other;so i think
Other;so i think one of the things we'recoming out is the roadÇ-i don't know if it has lanes so much as ithas, you know left, straight, right
Other;so i think we
Other;so i would
Other;so if an intersection has a sensor, thenÇ-i think is that assimple as this intersection having api with the road calls?
Other;so if we
Other;so in terms of software
Other;so it depends
Other;so it seems like they're designing
Other;so it sounds like the intersection needs to basically grab from thisroad to whatever connected road it needs to go.
Other;so let's get into that.
Other;so let's go with the minimum so
Other;so our intersectionsÇ-so it seems like our real thing isÇ-now
Other;so roads is the means by traffic gets to each individualintersection so we have to have a connection ofÇ-the intersectionhave to be connected in some way. so that the roads would beour connection points
Other;so that if
Other;so that way the road
Other;so that's another
Other;so the big rocks we're putting in the jar are
Other;so there's
Other;so there's this protected left
Other;so there's this, this relationship here. each road connects to twointersections
Other;so this is really all the editing someone's
Other;so this road ends into one of its endpoints is an intersection
Other;so this, i think, is the model on which to build the end userapplication.
Other;so timing
Other;so to keep it moving
Other;so we definitely have
Other;so we have a model
Other;so we have this behavior
Other;so we kind
Other;so we want simple
Other;so we've got kind of this,
Other;so what are the aspects of the speed that are important?
Other;so which ones do
Other;so you
Other;so you just haverotating green, yellow, red
Other;so you've got an input
Other;so, we need aprotected left
Other;so. we can think
Other;this has a length, it never overflows, you know iften, five cars can fit then it's all
Other;yeah, because it could you know
Other;you follow thepercentage model then we can just calculate what that wouldmean for the entry source of cars coming in.
Other;you know, or input
Other;but i mean having a selection is probably makes it
Other;but is that?
Other;i Creative Conflict on that
Other;i donít see this specifically in the requirements
Other;i mean it could be one or two i guess
Other;i thought it would be different, but i guess this would also be fine
Other;itís not stated there, but we think it would be useful
Other;so i guess density is not enough
Other;Ö i donít understand
Other;ah okay, you say this is some kind of, yeah, but this could be possible in both cases
Other;and then we had the road endpoint which could either be a real endpoint or it could be an intersection
Other;and this i guess is easier than doing the same logic and afterwards subdividing the roads always
Other;and through the road endpoint it has one, two, four, Ö is possible, fourteen is not good
Other;and we either have a real intersection or we have an end point
Other;but also for calculating statistics
Other;but first maybe we can discuss how to, whatís the best way to define the problem in itself
Other;but i assume roads will also be a form of association
Other;but i donít know
Other;but i would assume
Other;but if you say map is our starting point and everything is connected to this by association or something like that would be fine for me.
Other;but itís just the surrounding
Other;but maybe first
Other;but the overall implementation should be able to work with more roads or less.
Other;but then again how would you declare
Other;but we want to say if we make a throughput through the system via endpoints we would have traffic on endpoints
Other;but why do i want to move the intersection?
Other;but why donít we have a traffic model per se?
Other;but would traffic class in that case, does it make sense to have the relation to the road itself
Other;do we really have an actual intersection as an item or is it just indirectly given if you do an intersection?
Other;do we want to make it easy and just have density as part of the road or do we want to make something more sophisticated in terms of traffic models.
Other;donít know per what
Other;for me it maybe doesnít make sense to have this as a specific intersection, maybe there we would have something different which is a kind of road entry or road exit
Other;i asked if that is what you wanted, but it sounds like it was not
Other;i donít know how much details we have
Other;i donít know how to call it but we can also use it to influence the traffic from outside, which could be something specific
Other;i donít know.
Other;i mean another alternative would be to just have something like a default timing which you can change
Other;i mean if we view a road that is the whole thing, the whole map, i mean it could have multiple intersections,
Other;i would say both is good. i think default timing should also be available or which is always given and then you can define which default timing can be used.
Other;iím just thinking not only from a visualization perspective but also from a simulation perspective
Other;iím not so sure about that
Other;iím not sure
Other;iím not sure what you mean by subset
Other;if later on we have something not just four way but with this t-crossing, then we should easily be able to support this
Other;if the map is changing in a way that you add another intersection in between the appearances of roads are recalculated, but this then is a letís say more complex part and you need to copy the attributes and so on so it shouldnít be so difficult
Other;if the system is working, then additional things will be requested and itís better to have it already separated instead of putting all in one class
Other;if the traffic model should be completely separate entity here, which relates to the map or if we should just make it easier just make the roads have a simple density.
Other;if we are going for a more model-view-controller pattern or something like that maybe we want to separate the visualization in some sense
Other;if we want to make it more advanced in the future like you said with the more detailed definition of traffic for which kind of cars and so on we already have the right entry
Other;if we want to take the five we can make it even easier and say that roads have a single attribute saying density or something like that
Other;if you follow the assignment i mean there is specifically mentioned traffic density for the roads, but then it wonít be as easy to calculate something like system throughput or anything like that so it could also be hard to simulate letís say the time it takes for a single car from point a to point b
Other;if you move the intersection the road will become longer so i guess the velocity will have a different impact on the total throughput.
Other;if you want to evaluate traffic, evaluate the performance of the traffic lights as a system itself
Other;it could be open ended, it could be, i guess anything. a house or something
Other;itís not specifically defined but the purpose
Other;letís say you are in editor mode in the map and you want to move an intersection or something like that. then moving that intersection would be very complicated, because you would have to take into account how the roads were drawn initially and so on.
Other;maybe i miss something right now but these are for my feelings the things we could represent in the class model.
Other;mean if you only have one visual element then there is no point for it
Other;of course we can represent this here but we should also keep in mind that this could be changed in the future and that we should design the system that is able to change this.
Other;so four
Other;so if it comes to density i would add the traffic item not just having a description on the road, because i guess in which direction you are going, you want to have it more advanced and if we are starting the system these kinds of requirements will come
Other;so if we donít have any traffic model per se we are only talking about how much density there is on a single road
Other;so if we take this example and you just want to move this intersection over here instead. you have a road going out there, and another one going there, and another one going there.
Other;so itís clear that there could be not any more than four way intersections
Other;so itís stated that it is related to the intersection, not to the road.
Other;so then if i add a third road, then i would have this
Other;so then you could follow an individual car how it goes through the map and then the simulation of every car that would be the traffic model with a density for a single road and so on.
Other;so traffic light behavior can be defined
Other;so we have to choose, one of them has to be open ended so to speak.
Other;so you have the road endpoint, okay, and therefore we have, what was it? the road has two endpoints
Other;t could be either a real endpoint or an intersection
Other;this makes the calculation more complicated, but on the other hand itís something like if we donít want to design or define traffic per road which is one of the tasks or requirements.
Other;traffic is not visualized really, and we could also have a visualization of the traffic, could make sense
Other;we donít have i mean the visualization for it and iím not sure how we should.
Other;we should have both
Other;yes, either a road or intersection. you can see the details.
Other;you are right, based on the current things it doesnít make too much sense that you have this reuse of traffic
Other;but of course also
Other;if it was green before, we have to change
Other;if we select
Other;if we, first time when you draw something and then try to play
Other;meant that if we want to detect it automatically we have to say
Other;, i am not sure
Other;ah, ok because that was something i was just wondering about, whether we should
Other;am still not sure how to
Other;and of course the, that i guess, that itís not something that we have to design
Other;and so, or sequences or more than one traffic
Other;anyway, but that the
Other;because otherwise the other cars just need to wait until no more cars actually crossing the traffic light and we need to take this into account.
Other;because otherwise this might result in a crash
Other;because then this might result in an accident
Other;but does the user need to be able to define in our simplified version?
Other;but how should that work
Other;but i am not sure, where
Other;but i donít know how to easily program that kind of behavior
Other;but i donít think it is necessary, but i mean that depends
Other;but i don't know that's also
Other;but i mean a very easy way, oh but then you have to rename them
Other;but i think it might not be very handsome for meaning for the
Other;but if
Other;but of course would increase the complexity of the
Other;but rather focus
Other;but that they reference each other in some way.
Other;but thatís what i meant with my circles
Other;but then
Other;but then i mean
Other;but then i was thinking about how to describe the sequence and
Other;but we probably also need to take some delay into account
Other;can both of them be orange at the same time for example?
Other;exactly
Other;i am not sure
Other;i am not sure how to deal with the wave her.
Other;i didnít take it into account that it says that enters the map on a given road, so but then itís probably better to do like this at the start of the road or at the end of the road,
Other;i donít know
Other;i donít know how to design it
Other;i donít know,
Other;i donít think so,
Other;i mean the easiest way is to just have as you said, timings
Other;i think so because you should be able to have, you should be able to have intersections with no sensors then the intersections lights should be able to change based on the input from these sensors, so then
Other;i was just thinking about the other possibility, whether we should design it like this: in an intersection
Other;if the user has to use the intersection symbol then we could definitely do it like this
Other;if we have multiple intersections and then of course
Other;if you assign like some kind of ids or whatsoever to the traffic light then perhaps one traffic light could reference another traffic light and the theoretically.
Other;if you draw road here it should, you should be
Other;if you know it then you can take it into account
Other;if you set, if you set the one with the arrow, if you set that one to being green 30 seconds then you know that that one the other one is up and down right
Other;if you will start simulation
Other;itís a simple solution but we could do it some way different like this but then we would probably need some kind of main, i donít know, main traffic light or reference point for the traffic lights so that we know, when will which one start and which one, so i mean
Other;mean if we consider our example, i mean in some way, letís just
Other;no, i donít know, that doesnít matter.
Other;o maybe i mean, thatís the thing, you just have to draw a road, because all of them should have traffic lights
Other;ok, yeah
Other;or do we need this for every intersection?
Other;or down to up
Other;or one
Other;or other shorts what you defined with the circle, letís just say for the safe of complicity, itís like this, so then this one would be green in the beginning and by no car would be in this area, no car would be here, thatís, here we have these two nice cars
Other;or should you be able to set like, this is car spawn, the car spawn, which spawns cars and this is like a sync where cars disappear.
Other;perhaps this is not a very good idea to draw in this direction
Other;perhaps we simplify draw intersections for lazy students
Other;so basically
Other;so create a crash if this car would drive here
Other;so either they should be able to use go like 20 seconds red, blablabla blablabla or depending on this senso
Other;so i donít know
Other;so i mean
Other;so if you can set how long the one that you draw an arrow to if she said this one to 20 seconds green and maybe orange or yellow,
Other;so that is i mean the easiest i guess
Other;so then you have an intersection
Other;so there is no undo
Other;so we can see what we
Other;so we have
Other;thatís right, i Creative Conflict, so we should
Other;the question is whether we, should they put the sensors wide away or whether we should do try to find a means brake without the sensors and see whether itís a, what we achieve there
Other;use the road symbol and also draw intersections like this then of course we would need to allow him to draw traffic light symbols in addition to that
Other;whether you should be able to position this car spawning symbol at the beginning or whether it should be just able to detect this is the beginning of the road
Other;which would of course require us to be able to, i donít know, either
Other;yeah i mean it would be interesting because then you can create more complex pattern and so, or sequences or more than one traffic light.
Other;yeah so then we should be able to connect them somehow.
Other;yeah, exactly
Other;yeah, exactly, thatís what i mean,
Other;yeah, for me it doesnít matter
Other;yeah, i am not sure,
Other;yeah, of course we could also do it like this
Other;yeah, yeah
Other;you have to switch to green or to orange or red
Other;i donít see anything.
Other;does that saygreen, red, and left?
Other;does the network also split up the roads
Other;how do icreate an intersection
Other;is itthe same thing?
Other;where does that say off ramp?
Other;would that be a property of the queue or a property of thecar?
Other;you mean the actual data structures?
Other;and what does that mean?
Other;but what constitutes a well?movingtraffic
Other;but what does the intersection, what is the purpose of theintersection in life
Other;right
Other;how do you coordinate that between all signals at eachintersection?
Other;is it a push or a pull model with the intersections
Other;so howÇ-what is the behavior of the inputs andwould there be any requirements on that?
Other;that's where i always liketo start. how do you see the code beingÇ-just kind of thestructure of it being broken down?
Other;the only thing i'm kind of botheredis how do weÇ-how does this guy come into play in all of this?
Other;would it add a car?
Other;ah road density or traffic density?
Other;by moving the intersection you mean also changing the geometrical appearance of the roads?
Other;do you just want to be able to design the traffic for one of the parts?
Other;do you want to only be able to design the overall thing, which then would be an issue regarding the traffic
Other;is a road always that ending at an intersection or is a road like the designer when he starts to design the map, like i did right now?
Other;is it the traffic of the whole system or the traffic of a single road
Other;so whatís the difference between the visual map and the rad layout
Other;so you just mean the attributes regarding sensor and the assigned traffic lights and traffic behavior?
Other;what do you mean bigger level?
Other;what do you mean by moving the intersection?
Other;what do you want to say?
Other;what is the traffic class actually representing
Other;what were you thinking?
Other;why what? the part i donít get is why we donít have traffic density.
Other;yes, i mean my main point is what would be part of that view?
Other;you mean attributes describing the geometrical positioning of everything?
Other;do they have to?
Other;in the four?
Other;is there a certain reason for you drawing this options of like roads or traffic signs to the right hand side of the window?
Other;is this how they set, did you mean, by adding car symbols?
Other;what do you mean?
Other;which other one
Other;yeah, which one starts, yeah exactly, which one is triggered first, thatís what you mean?
Other;yeah, you mean that we somehow connect them?
Other;you mean the signals of the same intersection
Other;you wouldnít provide some kind of element to draw intersections immediately but rather focus on drawing streets and then for like crossing streets we then have intersections that should be detected automatically?
Other;actually i [inaudible] should either.
Other;ah okay, you say this is some kind of, yeah, but this could be possible in both cases
Other;i would say both is good. i think default timing should also be available or which is always given and then you can define which default timing can be used.
Other;iím just thinking not only from a visualization perspective but also from a simulation perspective
Other;we should have both
Other;yes, either a road or intersection. you can see the details.
Other;no, i donít know, that doesnít matter.
Other;yeah, for me it doesnít matter
Conversation Management;okay so it says that's up to us
Conversation Management;and nowshould we try
Conversation Management;and then come up with progressively--start off with thesimplest user story, and then progressively add user stories3and then maybe have pictures to illustrate how in our systemthose user stories will be achieved
Conversation Management;at least we can go through it right now. a few tables
Conversation Management;fifteen minutes into documenting,talking about the engineering design, code structure
Conversation Management;i guess we should write some of these things down.
Conversation Management;i was thinking we could startwith what we have now and fall on a user story of runningthis simulation now.
Conversation Management;i'm sort of reminded of the fact that we're supposed to allowlights to have sets of rules
Conversation Management;i'm wondering with half an hour left if we need to thinkabout how to--
Conversation Management;let's sketch a ui
Conversation Management;maybe we can peg that for the moment and introducethat as we flush this out.
Conversation Management;maybe we should start talking about the u
Conversation Management;should we start soon?
Conversation Management;so basic--design a basic structure of code.so to me, that's where we've got the model. the model anda little bit of how controller controls the model.
Conversation Management;so should we talk about end [inaudible
Conversation Management;well let's stick to the grid
Conversation Management;well now, intersection class
Conversation Management;we'll tackle that when we get there
Conversation Management;well we can write that down
Conversation Management;where's the first place to start?
Conversation Management;yeah maybe let's start with thenetwork
Conversation Management;does the professor want the students to learn that through trialand error
Conversation Management;goal is that as many cars are moving at any given time asclose to speed limit as possible
Conversation Management;his is always the point where i'm scared toerase the board. we need to take a picture of that.
Conversation Management;it's kind of like i go back, like what is exactly theoutput, you kno
Conversation Management;letme erase over here. it's this stuff that i'm worried about. it'skind of sketchy.
Conversation Management;lets assume this, lets assume it's inside a city so...
Conversation Management;summarize the unclaritiesthat we had for professor e
Conversation Management;this is something where i'd go back to the customer and tryand figure out
Conversation Management;this is when i pull out my camera
Conversation Management;this is why we need to check with theprofessor again
Conversation Management;where are you drawing
Conversation Management;let's see what other data do we pull out
Conversation Management;call it a [inaudible] requirement. cool. let's check for anyother...
Conversation Management;concerned with too much detail before weevenÇ-otherwise we're going to cut stuff out.
Conversation Management;i think we haveÇ-we can probably numerate the rules we'regoing to need too.
Conversation Management;i want to start by hearing your summary of this
Conversation Management;let's dive into that a little bit.
Conversation Management;let's explore that
Conversation Management;let's put it in there and we'll capture that.
Conversation Management;let's take that oneout
Conversation Management;so let's hide that detail. [inaudible].
Conversation Management;start twoengineers on the model, one engineer on the ui. get the modelgoing ahead. cool.
Conversation Management;the next step i would do is to
Conversation Management;we should model that
Conversation Management;guess we are also finished regarding the time, i guess we can stop here.
Conversation Management;i guess we can just restart
Conversation Management;i mean best we have 20 minutes.
Conversation Management;it could be some kind of traffic connected but we can also just leave it for now
Conversation Management;maybe we can remove it afterwards for other discussions?
Conversation Management;say okay we do a different tree on the right side which is just the overall items and these could be specific items which are road.
Conversation Management;should we go lower again and restart from the beginning, i donít think itís too difficult.
Conversation Management;ah okay, we have some time left. thirty minutes, okay
Conversation Management;but i just mark it blue to say we think it would be useful and should we go in this direction but to make a clear difference to what was our initial purpose regarding the requirements
Conversation Management;but i would make a statement like, what is it, zoom out, view and the model ad in between there should be some kind of controller, i put it here.
Conversation Management;but it really relates to exactly how ambitious we are
Conversation Management;but this should be something we keep in mind saying thatÖ maybe i can write it here that this needs to be recalculated
Conversation Management;do we have other items we are currently missing?
Conversation Management;how longÖ should we do this to 10.30?
Conversation Management;how much time is left? 10.30?
Conversation Management;i can also do it in blue as it is not part of the requirements.
Conversation Management;i think, i mean from the mental point of view i mean we are more or less done even if we define the controller and some use cases itís more boiler plate type of things.
Conversation Management;i will draw traffic, traffic light and traffic light behavior in parallel
Conversation Management;i would say itís too much, we donít get this done in time.
Conversation Management;later on we could also have this for the purposes you have described that all the attributes of the car like length or speed could influence the traffic at all.
Conversation Management;maybe for now itís fine in that way.
Conversation Management;maybe thatís also something that we cannot design right now in time
Conversation Management;maybe we check again the requirements, just go maybe through what we have or if we have everything.
Conversation Management;not that i can think of, maybe we can read the requirements again.
Conversation Management;now we can move it.
Conversation Management;okay then maybe letís check again the requirements
Conversation Management;so itís currently maybe a question how much is really necessary
Conversation Management;so maybe we draw this and then we make a component diagram sketch on saying which items we would put together and thatís it
Conversation Management;so maybe you start to do something and then i will continue that
Conversation Management;suspect we are going to have a lot of use cases, not sure we have the time for that.
Conversation Management;then i will remove it again
Conversation Management;this is also why i would do this in blue meaning this could also be an additional information
Conversation Management;this is where iím thinking about kind of which view we should have on this,
Conversation Management;what is the next?
Conversation Management;what was the timing? how much time is left for the design phase? (asking andreas) who?
Conversation Management;yes i would say letís start easy and we can add additional things later on
Conversation Management;ah no, this is not working
Conversation Management;ah, ok, so i donít know why, at least we can both draw
Conversation Management;ah, yes, ok, itís fine, so once again i will also try to draw something, ok?
Conversation Management;and further we figure to, i mean we can delete it afterwards.
Conversation Management;but ok, should we leave the main window as it is. i have it as a paper in my hand
Conversation Management;first of should we both zoom out to the maximum so that we always see everything?
Conversation Management;i donít think so
Conversation Management;i think thatís everything to be said.
Conversation Management;i think this should be the only issue right now
Conversation Management;i thought i was drawing again, perhaps we need to activate the mouse again
Conversation Management;mean first we can assign numbers here to be able to talk about it.
Conversation Management;ok
Conversation Management;ok, finger works
Conversation Management;ok, perhaps, i need to read this bullet point c again to actual look what it says
Conversation Management;ok, so where did we stop?
Conversation Management;outside, oh yeah
Conversation Management;perhaps, there are just some basic question in the beginning
Conversation Management;so basically we could do first thing what was on the lefthand side, what i was trying to achieve here
Conversation Management;so some streets again, delete that later
Conversation Management;so thatís no, i think we didnít draw so much, so thatís no big deal
Conversation Management;so what should we start with?
Conversation Management;this is for demonstration purposes.
Conversation Management;we can start right again.
Conversation Management;we start all very again?
Conversation Management;well, the question is, if it is not working, you would need to do the drawing stuff.
Conversation Management;what should we try to get it working or?
Conversation Management;yeah
Conversation Management;yeah do you want to summarise?
Conversation Management;yeah i see
Conversation Management;yeah, i mean, perhaps you can just add something, if i forget something
Conversation Management;yeah, no problem.
Conversation Management;yeah?
Conversation Management;yes
Other;what basic data structures are we looking at here?
Other;actually start coding up the datastructures themselves
Other;but i imagine the controller controls that, right, the modelbasically is just the basically cars, the queue of cars, theintersection contains four queues.
Other;i'm thinking, yeah, i'm thinking in terms of model-êviewcontroller
Other;mean it might be thedesign pattern. a traverser, observer, traverser
Other;object being traversed and somerule for--so it's easy the traverser, visitor pattern you get thevisitor case on the auto-êtype and then it could be [inaudible
Other;to separate the ui off andwe want the underlying data structures and supporting things
Other;model-view-controller pattern
Other;then we have the model, we have the view, but we donít have the controller
Other;we have a statement that we do model view controller pattern
Other;is part of the intersection
Other;i don't [inaudible] into it.
Other;i don't think we need to make assumption of lanes, period
Other;i donít see this specifically in the requirements
Other;for me it maybe doesnít make sense to have this as a specific intersection, maybe there we would have something different which is a kind of road entry or road exit
Other;and of course the, that i guess, that itís not something that we have to design
Other;but of course would increase the complexity of the
Other;i donít think so,
Other;i think so because you should be able to have, you should be able to have intersections with no sensors then the intersections lights should be able to change based on the input from these sensors, so then
Other;no
Other;i don't know
Other;i don't know how to actually structure this
Other;wonder if atfirst approximation never [inaudible] in roads.
Other;and i wonder
Other;i don't know if this isany better
Other;i mean i'm wondering could youadd
Other;i wonder if
Other;i'm notquite sure
Other;just wonder if maybe the important
Other;well, i don't know
Other;i almost wonder if, i don't know.
Other;i don't know how sensors work.
Other;i don't know if professor e really wants that level ofdetail
Other;i don't know if they can set thespeeds
Other;i don't know if you can changethese as well while you're going.
Other;i don't know if. but youalready got this on there,
Other;i don't know so much
Other;i don't know,
Other;i don't know.
Other;i don't knowthat almost feels like
Other;i don'tknow
Other;i don'tknow exactly how to capture this
Other;i'm not reallysure
Other;i'm not sure.
Other;i'm still thinking
Other;now i don't know
Other;oh that's not going to quite work.
Other;or did i readsomething there that said it has some
Other;this is where we still have a little doubt
Other;, i'm not sure
Other;but i don't know
Other;i'm not sure
Other;i'm still wondering about the leftÇ-turn lane.
Other;Ö i donít understand
Other;but i donít know
Other;donít know per what
Other;i donít know how much details we have
Other;i donít know.
Other;iím not so sure about that
Other;iím not sure
Other;iím not sure what you mean by subset
Other;we donít have i mean the visualization for it and iím not sure how we should.
Other;, i am not sure
Other;ah, ok because that was something i was just wondering about, whether we should
Other;am still not sure how to
Other;but how should that work
Other;but i am not sure, where
Other;but i donít know how to easily program that kind of behavior
Other;but i don't know that's also
Other;can both of them be orange at the same time for example?
Other;i am not sure
Other;i am not sure
Other;i am not sure how to deal with the wave her.
Other;i donít know
Other;i donít know how to design it
Other;i donít know,
Other;i donít know.
Other;perhaps this is not a very good idea to draw in this direction
Other;so i donít know
Other;the question is whether we, should they put the sensors wide away or whether we should do try to find a means brake without the sensors and see whether itís a, what we achieve there
Other;which would of course require us to be able to, i donít know, either
Other;yeah, i am not sure,
Other;a bit more usable so i Creative Conflict
Other;advanced in the future
Other;and then the point could be i guess for future could define anything
Other;it would also be always given indirectly. it takes less work for the editing, you can easily just draw the lines and each time you would have here endpoints an intersections which are all calculated automatically and then by selecting an intersection you could describe the movement of an intersection, which is a more advanced algorithm to relayout the whole thing.
Other;of course we can represent this here but we should also keep in mind that this could be changed in the future and that we should design the system that is able to change this.
Other;so i see a reuse potential there
Other;yes i would keep the traffic class also for reuse purposes
Other;advanced in the future
Other;and then the point could be i guess for future could define anything
Other;it would also be always given indirectly. it takes less work for the editing, you can easily just draw the lines and each time you would have here endpoints an intersections which are all calculated automatically and then by selecting an intersection you could describe the movement of an intersection, which is a more advanced algorithm to relayout the whole thing.
Other;of course we can represent this here but we should also keep in mind that this could be changed in the future and that we should design the system that is able to change this.
Other;so i see a reuse potential there
Other;yes i would keep the traffic class also for reuse purposes
Other;and the results of pushing and popping.
Other;and then some t, at some point t one later.
Other;i mean you could go top left
Other;so the cop looks at the intersections says okay it's Creative Conflictn light on these roads. this road has some number ofcars in it. if the lights green one tick means we pop and wedo that queue and second picture. so, from t zero to t onethat's how we've gone through two
Other;that kicks off events and then which then make a [inaudible
Other;that kicks off events.
Other;the other way
Other;this guywould have the sensor state,
Other;unless you're the terminator and you've beamed acar.
Other;until he passes the intersection, or whatever. and gets onthe next road
Other;we're saying there's a, so then, these are objects right.so, maybe what happens is the clock is the controller, it'schanging the state of time so time can tick, right, that's anamount of time. the clock does the ticking, right, and nowthe tick, time is part of model that is state, but as timechanges some cop object or something responds to timechanges, right, and is responsible for changing state ofmodel.
Other;also
Other;also, i mean it seems
Other;and it just tell them, hey full or heyi don't have any. so it's not it's own little thinking component.
Other;and then test it, are you full?
Other;aslong asÇ-also being able to control
Other;imean it comes back to this whole problem that we were toyingwith.
Other;what did i say? ìroad endpointsî, four and one. then we would have ìroadî
Other;also we have it on the laptop screen
Other;also before we draw again so first i can right now try to save the image
Other;are they controlling
Other;so they can build on?
Other;something?
Other;, this would be visible
Other;i mean how do you visualize this simulation
Other;what does that mean?
Other;what else are we going to be drawing?
Other;so in total?
Other;the sensors?
Other;what about it?
Other;do you have a better statement?
Other;i mean what are the types of metrics that we want to have in percent?
Other;well i like what you're saying, i like the idea
Other;when jim is present, only jim does the board, as you see hishand?writing, his ability to use markers is remarkable, so noone approaches the board, he's very good.
Other;ahh that's brilliant
Other;cool, cool. sounds good
Other;cool, i like that
Other;excellent, excellent.
Other;good question.
Other;i like that. cool.
Other;interesting
Other;that is a great point
Other;i think itís a good and great idea
Other;thatís a good point
Other;yes i Creative Conflict. great
Other;yes thatís a good idea.
Other;yes, i think itís a good idea
Other;as capacity increases, the wait time doesn't increaseproportionally
Other;it'sreally just a list of road, road pairs i guess, and thenintersections
Other;then this way wecan, it's really the network that runs the road,
Other;what i'm thinking is like you have this data structure of thistraffic cop that responds to ticks by analyzing the state of thetraffic signal and then, you know, pushes cars on and offqueue depending on the -ê
Other;the traffic pattern object, the big guy, owns all the cars,and as it manufactures them, as it factors them out, it createsthem in some flavor,
Other;and by default it eitherhas or does not have a timing setting, so very quickly you cancreate something without fussing with it too much, and bydefault it has to assume
Other;but i'm saying that you would say that 10% of cars willbehave like this, 10% will go straight, 10% will go tointersections and turn
Other;how do you assess, you know, what is the optimalósothis is the grid, what is the optimal setting of the intersectionconfigurations with this traffic pattern.
Other;how far is it between each leg orwhatever, each segment.
Other;so we assume they have some sort of a pallet here where theygrab a road and they start dragging and then they drag that, sothere is some sort of drawing pallet right, that says okay i havethis thing i drag something, i'm drawing a road and i call itsomething and i draw and i call it b and i draw my roads andthen.
Other;that, and it also pushesit up to the road, so the road can aggregate, create the reportslater for all the intersections it has so we can aggregate thesething, so you can aggregate so you can get individualinformation on each car, on each intersection, on each road
Other;the intersection knows how many cars it has, and fullinventory of each car's direction, status, waiting, and waitingfor what.
Other;this is an approach
Other;i mean, the roads have a length
Other;i mean with that they havetwo intersections coming to four turn lanes, i mean that's theproblem
Other;i'mtrying to figure out how to capture the state of a car going down aspecific road
Other;kind of the situation of how they are physically doesn't matter,we just more care about what's leading up to it, and what it'sleading off to.
Other;that's the real scenario
Other;what i'm wondering is that, is it one of thoseÇ-
Other;. you would have some kind of patterns for traffic lights, different ones which you will use on different intersections
Other;at least a starting point and end point
Other;for me itís the traffic on a single road
Other;you should be able to say how many cars per or something it should create
Other;you wouldnít provide some kind of element to draw intersections immediately but rather focus on drawing streets and then for like crossing streets we then have intersections that should be detected automatically?
Other;and ithas a queue, which of course has push [inaudible]. okay.
Other;it has sensors and, it has the timing, current state, no it hasticks in current state
Other;n = new network,, c = new clock. andthen we go c.run(n).
Other;so maybe this is public and this is private in the sensethat you only ever have roads in the network when it's at theintersections because i don't think, i'm trying to
Other;permutations that happen at eachintersection
Other;reallywhen you're filling out stuff about an intersection, you're fillingout information about each of the approaches
Other;this in html.reporting
Other;, i was kind of assuming simple db here.
Other;would need to be persistable.
Other;and not the primitive type that was essentially
Other;but the overall implementation should be able to work with more roads or less.
Other;for now we donít have any attributes for the endpoint
Other;in there, there is a boolean attribute indicating the sensors are available.
Other;is it an attribute for the road?
Other;so letís add an interface then
Other;so we do some kind of extra class or interface for intersection
Other;the name for the interface
Other;okay so it says that's up to us
Other;so dowe want to have visualization of cars moving along aparticular road in a geometric sense?
Other;so now the push is not just the random numbergenerator for frequency, but there's also random numbergenerator for zero one for left versus right
Other;. so add road could potentially have, what's theplace you could ever, you did this.
Other;but should readily accommodate six intersections--okayso we can actually accommodate [inaudible] larger
Other;create a road there's no intersection, so road existsoutside of the intersection
Other;it would have multiple lanes so thatin a sense it has multiple queues
Other;like so that you've got this intersection next to thisintersection and if this road fills up, then even
Other;right so this is now a ui piece and the dot, brings up youreditor with frequency of, your frequency value
Other;so
Other;so all these lines of
Other;so clock is a controller
Other;so do you want
Other;so for every tick, the analytics guy does asweep, collecting statistical data about the state of each tick
Other;so foreach road in the simulation we look at the car at the head ofthe queue
Other;so get rid of this
Other;so highlight
Other;so i
Other;so i can see traffic flow across it.
Other;so i think that might bethe best way to communicate interaction design.
Other;so i think that's
Other;so i was thinking
Other;so if the
Other;so i'll use a soliddot to mean ownership and then an open dot to meanreferencing. so the network owns the roads, the networkowns the intersections but the intersection can referencethese in and out roads. alright, so i guess we need, addroad
Other;so i'm thinking maybe
Other;so instead of just a straight
Other;so is there someone looking at the networksaying the average congestion is, or the average wait time ofa car is,
Other;so it might be thatthe road has some number of, an ordered list of cars that aremoving along the road and only when they get to the end ofthe road do they get pushed into the queue.
Other;so it should
Other;so it's a visit
Other;so it's got to be just a grid likethat. that's fine.
Other;so it's like8you're inferring intersection at crossings.
Other;so it's saying at each tick we see where the problems occurand maybe make a road blink red if it's full and
Other;so i've got two car lengths
Other;so let's
Other;so max cars, holds n.1
Other;so maybe
Other;so maybe it'sreally a function of the result of how the intersections arelaid out. and the relationship between the intersection. 8
Other;so maybe we
Other;so mostly straight and sometimes
Other;so next userstory
Other;so that comes back toanalytics right?
Other;so that kind of comes into car
Other;so that thisintersection is connected to this one, or is that
Other;so that would
Other;so that you
Other;so that's just the function or the property on thelight
Other;so that's one thing, and also like how longthese signals stay green
Other;so that's the basic way to kick it all off i guess
Other;so the cop as,
Other;so the empty network is what we started outwith a blank page, as they drag a road on, that instantiates aroad object
Other;so the only other way youcan get through
Other;so the pop
Other;so the random number
Other;so then you drag
Other;so therandom
Other;so there needs to be some logic about, wellthat's interesting so there's a notion of the road in, road out.
Other;so there's through here, off ramp and onramp right
Other;so this is interesting, so now should allow for roads of anylength to be placed
Other;so this network or graph hasadditional constraints.
Other;so this one piece of state we haven't captured is whether aroad is an interior or we should call it an onramp
Other;so this whole thing we should talk about road, got this modelcontrol or
Other;so we
Other;so we almost don't need a--well, we need car to havesomething in the queue
Other;so we could come
Other;so we makeroads, right. so one m of intersections and we would haveroad connected to the intersection or the intersection has2paths
Other;so we need to communicate the interaction
Other;so we want to, you know, does thishappen basically.
Other;so wecould introduce a notion of speed into our queue
Other;so we're
Other;so we're getting some credit collection of rules here
Other;so we've created a basic [inaudible] for it to run in.
Other;so we've got a great
Other;so when it comes
Other;so where you
Other;so you can't
Other;so you click an
Other;so you have a consistent road network.
Other;so you have to explain
Other;so you want the
Other;so youcould simplify
Other;so you're
Other;so you're just doing it
Other;so, go ahead
Other;so, something happens as an external controller is ticking themodel
Other;sodoes it have a sensor, yes, no
Other;sothat we
Other;sothis can be bigger than the window so scrolling, stuff likethat
Other;then this guy would have a state. it's like okay i'vebeen in this state for two ticks, go to three don't change, goto four change, something like that. right, so this guy has anotion of the state of the light but also time and currentstate, right. so, the clock ticks, the cop says look at whatlights are green, one tick means one car goes through so wepop off the end of the queue, we say the cop notices the endof the intersection has been in this state for one tick so nochange needs to be made. and then we get the same greenstate
Other;we're prettyconstrained in what we draw geometrically so it almostseems like it might be nice to [inaudible] the geometry fromthe simulation
Other;so once the car exists
Other;it'd have to be in 60 because you'd only get [inaudible] onthe green, [inaudible] on the red
Other;know there is an overlap when both of them are red,because people run yellow lights, and they run red lights at theend so you'd get a collision
Other;meaninglittle dots are moving, showing you how the traffic is flowing
Other;o
Other;okay, so that's another thing we want to be able to specify indrawing.
Other;so i think it'sa little confusing.
Other;so it would be 50 seconds
Other;so it's almost lik
Other;so it's like a drawing tool that can allow them to lay downthese intersections
Other;so one thing is
Other;so the
Other;so the intersection
Other;so the traffic pattern
Other;so then it's divided pretty much between green and...
Other;so then this would be intersection b2.
Other;so there is a finite number
Other;so this can get fairly complex very fast because you have allthese intersections
Other;so we don't need to really place traffic lights,
Other;so you couldn't
Other;so you're going to have
Other;there's kind of a drawing area here
Other;well, so one little thing besides laying out the roads. weneed some kind of visualization of the map
Other;so this is the left turnlane
Other;. and so you find this flow which islike,
Other;actually it doesn't require them to save it actually.so theoretically it's all good memory.
Other;and so can you hit
Other;and so instead of going from intersection
Other;and so this guy has this loop, this do sim loop,and these are kind of the drivers of the system
Other;and so we think about, termination of, do we get flow out of thissystem, do we think about
Other;basically this needs tomodel a set of use cases.
Other;so a lane has a signal, you know just kind of abstract.
Other;so basically each entry into the intersection there's going to be nnumber of signals
Other;so basically intersection is going to say to this road, you know r1,r2, r3, r4
Other;so basically there would be a queue
Other;so basically we need an option to say
Other;so each road is going
Other;so how are these signals
Other;so howÇ-what is the behavior of the inputs andwould there be any requirements on that?
Other;so i have a leftÇ-turn lane
Other;so i mean at that
Other;so i think
Other;so i think one of the things we'recoming out is the roadÇ-i don't know if it has lanes so much as ithas, you know left, straight, right
Other;so i think we
Other;so i would
Other;so if we
Other;so in terms of software
Other;so it depends
Other;so it seems like they're designing
Other;so it sounds like the intersection needs to basically grab from thisroad to whatever connected road it needs to go.
Other;so let's get into that.
Other;so let's go with the minimum so
Other;so our intersectionsÇ-so it seems like our real thing isÇ-now
Other;so roads is the means by traffic gets to each individualintersection so we have to have a connection ofÇ-the intersectionhave to be connected in some way. so that the roads would beour connection points
Other;so that if
Other;so that way the road
Other;so that's another
Other;so the big rocks we're putting in the jar are
Other;so there's
Other;so there's this protected left
Other;so there's this, this relationship here. each road connects to twointersections
Other;so this is really all the editing someone's
Other;so this road ends into one of its endpoints is an intersection
Other;so this, i think, is the model on which to build the end userapplication.
Other;so timing
Other;so to keep it moving
Other;so we definitely have
Other;so we have a model
Other;so we have this behavior
Other;so we kind
Other;so we want simple
Other;so we've got kind of this,
Other;so what are the aspects of the speed that are important?
Other;so which ones do
Other;so you
Other;so you just haverotating green, yellow, red
Other;so you've got an input
Other;so, we need aprotected left
Other;so. we can think
Other;so i guess density is not enough
Other;and this i guess is easier than doing the same logic and afterwards subdividing the roads always
Other;letís say you are in editor mode in the map and you want to move an intersection or something like that. then moving that intersection would be very complicated, because you would have to take into account how the roads were drawn initially and so on.
Other;so four
Other;so if it comes to density i would add the traffic item not just having a description on the road, because i guess in which direction you are going, you want to have it more advanced and if we are starting the system these kinds of requirements will come
Other;so if we take this example and you just want to move this intersection over here instead. you have a road going out there, and another one going there, and another one going there.
Other;so itís clear that there could be not any more than four way intersections
Other;so itís stated that it is related to the intersection, not to the road.
Other;so then you could follow an individual car how it goes through the map and then the simulation of every car that would be the traffic model with a density for a single road and so on.
Other;so traffic light behavior can be defined
Other;so you have the road endpoint, okay, and therefore we have, what was it? the road has two endpoints
Other;so i guess density is not enough
Other;and this i guess is easier than doing the same logic and afterwards subdividing the roads always
Other;letís say you are in editor mode in the map and you want to move an intersection or something like that. then moving that intersection would be very complicated, because you would have to take into account how the roads were drawn initially and so on.
Other;so four
Other;so if it comes to density i would add the traffic item not just having a description on the road, because i guess in which direction you are going, you want to have it more advanced and if we are starting the system these kinds of requirements will come
Other;so if we take this example and you just want to move this intersection over here instead. you have a road going out there, and another one going there, and another one going there.
Other;so itís clear that there could be not any more than four way intersections
Other;so itís stated that it is related to the intersection, not to the road.
Other;so then you could follow an individual car how it goes through the map and then the simulation of every car that would be the traffic model with a density for a single road and so on.
Other;because otherwise the other cars just need to wait until no more cars actually crossing the traffic light and we need to take this into account.
Other;because otherwise this might result in a crash
Other;because then this might result in an accident
Other;if we have multiple intersections and then of course
Other;o maybe i mean, thatís the thing, you just have to draw a road, because all of them should have traffic lights
Other;so basically
Other;so i mean
Other;so maybe
Other;so that is i mean the easiest i guess
Other;so then you have an intersection
Other;so there is no undo
Other;so we can see what we
Other;so we have
Other;use the road symbol and also draw intersections like this then of course we would need to allow him to draw traffic light symbols in addition to that
Other;i guess i should put wait time here, capacity here.
Other;it should bepossible to create a busy road or a seldom used one, or any 0variation in between.
Other;so that'scase one, that's case one. case two would be we've got aleft-êhand turn and we're either yellow or
Other;the cop is looking at well state of thesignal and the some
Other;, that's the complication that arises when you allowthat, is you have to figure out how it's--
Other;. a cop is kind of controlling the state of the model
Other;also don't need to push on herebecause the--this, you don't need to randomly push on herebecause all the cars coming in this queue are going to becoming from this road. either from here, or from there.
Other;also maybe analyze the load on an intersection for road, fora particular road
Other;although i mean theoretically you could do somethinglike this
Other;and as well as the signal.
Other;and it also corresponds to time
Other;and so the copsays okay, i try to tick, the intersections says i'm still or thatlight says i'm still green, and let's suppose this guy has rulessaying every four ticks change the colors of the lights.
Other;and so, should we say the initial state would be this lightsgreen and this lights green.
Other;and that also maybe also [inaudible] as the right hand turn
Other;and the fact that we can't have a t-êjunction keeps us fromdoing things like that, right
Other;and the results of pushing and popping.
Other;and then depending on 3what type of car, you queue it up on the lane.
Other;and then some t, at some point t one later.
Other;as capacity increases, the wait time doesn't increaseproportionally
Other;because cars into this road can come from here goingstraight, here turning left, or here turning right
Other;because each road can have adifferent rate.
Other;because i think observegets into the analytics
Other;because i think one of the goals here is tocommunicate this to
Other;because i'm having trouble
Other;because i'm thinking
Other;because it can't turn ifthe road in the opposite has cars in it.
Other;because it kind of applies
Other;because it's the cop that's receiving the tick, right?
Other;because let'ssuppose we make it so every
Other;because now as you drag thisone over you've got to make sure to drag that one over
Other;because roads kind of come in pairs as faras we're concerned
Other;because that might be avariable way of entering
Other;because that then really shows the success of the networkoverall
Other;because that's a way tothen, you know that's a way to sort
Other;because that'sthe queue for the light.
Other;because the popping logic, you can't pop ifthe other road is full
Other;because the simulation is supposed to be not just one
Other;because thenwho's responsible for coordinating.
Other;because they've got to be
Other;because we have directional graph andwe have [inaudible] and dopplets of what's a valid graph
Other;because we're not supposed to have t-êjunctionswe're supposed to have...
Other;because you could also, imean, theoretically you could also have an intersectionwhere this goes left and straight and this is just red.
Other;because your'e talking abouta kind of combination of a rule and an action,
Other;because, forinstance if this
Other;because--so anyway we go through the intersection
Other;because--this would be interesting things tosimulate.
Other;but i think that would become a bit spaghetti
Other;controls
Other;crossing roads
Other;cuz that's something
Other;directional -- okay. i'm thinking this is a queue, this is aqueue, this a queue.
Other;evaluation should be, should we say areable to evaluate per intersection or per
Other;here, maybe we should do it a little moreformally
Other;i guess aspects of parameters of the simulation, really
Other;i guess in our view that's not always true
Other;i guess the only last thing isthere are cars that are created by the--cars that are createdessentially by the cop and introduced into onramp roads.and they have certain states, we've said.
Other;i guess the other thing that would be--the other big piecehere is analytics,
Other;i mean you could go top left
Other;i meant connecting intersections
Other;i think we canassume we have a video camera rolling and we can gothrough the other scenarios
Other;i want to evaluate success of each simulation.
Other;i'm thinking that would be implicit inthe sense that i drag a road vertical, and i drag a roadhorizontal and the geometric--
Other;i'm thinking, yeah, i'm thinking in terms of model-êviewcontroller
Other;i'm wondering with half an hour left if we need to thinkabout how to--
Other;inaudible] has a type for a
Other;it might not even matter so much in that
Other;it seems like maybe, because then you have to then it'sseparate then you have to do them in sync. so maybe it'sreally a function of the result of how the intersections arelaid out. and the relationship between the intersection
Other;it sort of seems like it is appropriate because a copneeds to look at the top of the queue, or needs to look at thetop of the queue to see what kind of car it is
Other;it's almost like you just step up a level and have anobject called a network and that's the thing that assemblesintersection out of roads and knows whether its an exteriorroad or an interior road and all that
Other;it's almost like you need to traffic cop, right, traffic copcontroller
Other;it's an interior road if anotherroad--because this says you're going in here and out here sois this--is an interior road just one queue or in general
Other;it's coming together though, i think. it's just more rules.
Other;it's going
Other;it's like there's a network kind of as well saying, okaywell we--i have, this line here says for each road in thesimulation do something.
Other;it's not going to work. that's
Other;it's really a geometric property of the road
Other;it's sayinghow far along are you in your road
Other;it'sreally just a list of road, road pairs i guess, and thenintersections
Other;maybe this is this card, this push notion right now and just ahand wave and have it happening in a global sense
Other;maybe we randomize the--at a pop and push. wealso then randomize the actual direction of the car.
Other;my first inclination is to say, okay the rules if rules can getpushed into the objects and then tick maybe into the--distribute the rules into the network and then at every tickeach aspect, each car gets a tick, each intersection gets atick, each road gets a tick.
Other;my initial thinking was you'd have intersection object thatcontained four roads they're all incoming roads
Other;now left-êturn is a little more special
Other;now we're looking at this visually is thisnotion of speed of the car through a particular road
Other;oh right, like a traffic jam
Other;one car per tic.
Other;one thing we could simplify is, in order to get--because thismatters
Other;say some number of cars per minute while the lights green.
Other;say start with a model and start with the simplestmodel to get the simplest intersection flowing with cars andtiming
Other;so i guess then [inaudible] is no pop
Other;so intersection then we need car, we need the notionof time, this is a simulation of time
Other;so maybe a drawing of a, the simplest intersection, right, andan intersection, and have a particular road would have -ê it'sdirectional on either side, right. there are some number ofcars flowing on a particular road waiting at an intersection.there is a clock, right, that governs when the lights change.so, there are lights, right. this goes across the street rightthere.
Other;so maybe we should run through some,you know, how pictures will change from one moment oftime to another and think about how the software wouldcreate those pictures maybe.
Other;so our onramp, offramp
Other;so the cop looks at the intersections says okay it's Creative Conflictn light on these roads. this road has some number ofcars in it. if the lights green one tick means we pop and wedo that queue and second picture. so, from t zero to t onethat's how we've gone through two
Other;so the frequency f here is not a global to the network, it's asetting on a particular onramp road.
Other;so two things: design and interaction
Other;so we have to have some sort of timer model that
Other;so what i'm thinking is maybe there's arandom number generator here that has two inputs of likebasically the probability, right
Other;so, let's say delta one tic maybe or something
Other;so, one thing wehaven't talked about is how we in queue a car.
Other;so, yeah i guess at a very base level we kick everything offwith main( ). right
Other;somehow we need to represent the amount of trafficor traffic flow
Other;speed of simulation
Other;speed of the car
Other;start, observe, and then we'll put pause
Other;that kicks off events and then which then make a [inaudible
Other;that kicks off events.
Other;that's another thing is thelight
Other;the classjust gets huge and you end up [inaudible] it. but yeah, i likethe [inaudible
Other;the cop, let's do--so it has sort of rules
Other;the lane would be an addition of the road with somespecific logic data.
Other;the next direction of the car.
Other;the other way
Other;then this way wecan, it's really the network that runs the road,
Other;then what we're really trying to do isminimize the wait time
Other;therandom number generator could saturate the space on theroads.
Other;there's rules governing if you have two carsgoing into the same road, which goes first per tick,
Other;this guywould have the sensor state,
Other;this is a queue and what we're reallyinterested in is how those cars queue up, how big the queuesget, when the queues release and how many we can pop-êupthe end of the queue for some given clock tick. then we cankeep speed constant for
Other;this is starting to sound very--i mean i can already see thelength of the source file for the car
Other;those are randomly generated, and maybe thetype of car has a random output
Other;traverser of network
Other;two queues.
Other;unless you're the terminator and you've beamed acar.
Other;until he passes the intersection, or whatever. and gets onthe next road
Other;we could make this pretty simple
Other;we have some constraints on the flow of the queuesbecause we can't have lights coming in a collision course.
Other;we need something that represents intersections.
Other;we should talk about road, got this modelcontrol
Other;well capacity is a good one to have because then you canevaluate wait time per
Other;well it seems like a lot of the logic is going to be--a lot of thecomplication is going to be in the push and pop actions
Other;we're saying there's a, so then, these are objects right.so, maybe what happens is the clock is the controller, it'schanging the state of time so time can tick, right, that's anamount of time. the clock does the ticking, right, and nowthe tick, time is part of model that is state, but as timechanges some cop object or something responds to timechanges, right, and is responsible for changing state ofmodel.
Other;what i'm thinking is like you have this data structure of thistraffic cop that responds to ticks by analyzing the state of thetraffic signal and then, you know, pushes cars on and offqueue depending on the -ê
Other;where it could be going. and theseare basically, these better be pointing
Other;where you put these roads determines how the queue,the maximum number of cars in an intersection
Other;whether it has a sensor, and maybe some logic around--sortof setting in the rules we need some sort of rule editor
Other;would that be a property of the car onthe current wait time or something like that
Other;yeah maybe let's start with thenetwork
Other;yeah we could make it all horizontal and vertical roads soyou start on, off, on, off, intersection,
Other;you can't pick up thisintersection, it would make sense to move the entire road
Other;the traffic pattern object, the big guy, owns all the cars,and as it manufactures them, as it factors them out, it createsthem in some flavor,
Other;we'll say you should getstarted on this much, we need to go and clarify this withprofessor e
Other;also
Other;and also
Other;and by default it eitherhas or does not have a timing setting, so very quickly you cancreate something without fussing with it too much, and bydefault it has to assume
Other;and it also seems like
Other;and that's my point
Other;and then there's some way to
Other;and then we have some way of saying
Other;becaues
Other;because
Other;because in real life some intersections you cannot.
Other;because it knows where it's going
Other;because thatjust made it complex
Other;because the road knows about intersections, and then thewhole map.
Other;becauseas you start adjusting here it would go here as you wouldósoyou can almost go infinite here so it has to, you just give it.
Other;becauseotherwise
Other;becausethat'd
Other;but
Other;but also i think
Other;but i'm saying that you would say that 10% of cars willbehave like this, 10% will go straight, 10% will go tointersections and turn
Other;but its not necessary
Other;but jim did we finish with the cars kind of
Other;but you know that you brought up a point you know
Other;cause there's a lot of complexity
Other;deally, thesystem should be able to
Other;either
Other;erhaps theres
Other;hat's going to cause traffic problems here.
Other;how do you assess, you know, what is the optimalósothis is the grid, what is the optimal setting of the intersectionconfigurations with this traffic pattern.
Other;how far is it between each leg orwhatever, each segment.
Other;i could see in subsequent versions
Other;i feel likeyou should have to specify only maybe two directions orsomething
Other;i guess
Other;i guess that's all.
Other;i just think
Other;i like it better down there
Other;i mean
Other;i mean we couldjust say, you know, the distance between 1st street and 2ndstreet is this,
Other;i mean, we have to state this because if it's notó
Other;i think
Other;i think from the user's perspective
Other;i think it's just saying
Other;i think that's an importantpart of it
Other;i think the intersections just occur.
Other;i think this
Other;i think we kind of covered all thethings we wrote up here
Other;i think wehave to talk to professor e again, because she didn't specify themost important aspect of it, which is how do you know thatyour lighting system is working to its best potential? i candraw the map, i can specify all these parameters and now i runit, how do i know this is good
Other;i think we're going to have to rely on professor e forcreating the details about the theory of how that works. i mean,we might have to code whatever her understanding is of trafficlight theory into it
Other;i want to do
Other;i would go
Other;i would probably wantto be able to hover and somehow in?place edit
Other;i would say
Other;if
Other;i'll tell you what's going to be interesting is these students,whether there's civil engineers but, you know they're doingcomputer science stuff, so their next step after this is to takethe software that you've been given and program the smartsinto it so that it can do the timing for you automatically.
Other;i'm entertaining this idea
Other;i'm still unhappy
Other;i'm thinking
Other;i'mguessing
Other;in other words
Other;in other words it would seem to me that ideally you'dwant to draw this out of the box with all defaults and somedefault settings based on some package
Other;in other words,
Other;in the real world, you know, a can becurving and intersect 1 three times, and do an s and dead?end.
Other;is the traffic kind ofóyou know how some you havegreen one way but not on the other.
Other;is there a sensor?'
Other;it almost seems like
Other;it also seems
Other;it didn't sound like you need control at the individual carlevel
Other;it does seemlike
Other;it might
Other;it might be
Other;it seems like here,
Other;ithink
Other;let's start coding
Other;like during commuting hours everyoneworks over there, but the shopping center is down there, so onweekends everyone is going that way.
Other;like it could be like
Other;maybe
Other;maybe even you could
Other;maybe just click here
Other;maybe the way to approach
Other;maybe theres also
Other;maybe this is just a learning tool
Other;next release we'll let them add theirown fancy street names
Other;o i would take the map drawingas one thing
Other;o professor e says,this is your exam this is your project, here is a traffic pattern,this is the grid, what is the optimal traffic light settings? figurethat out. and so how do you, you know, and again i think itwould be up to the customer, the professor, in this case, tospecify what optimal means, what is allowed wait?time, howmany traffic, you know people waiting on the lights, right, all ofthat.
Other;of course we're not going and talking to her, we're going to talkto the team of software developers
Other;okay so then we have a map
Other;okay, i say i want fifty cars on the grid, but i don't want themall going the same way.
Other;one thing that we're kind of missing there
Other;right now i would just leave it
Other;should not allow
Other;so
Other;so i think
Other;so i would start simple, jim.
Other;so if we did 2 minutes, that's 120 seconds. so the entireduration is 120 seconds
Other;so it could be
Other;so let's build
Other;so let's just say for
Other;so lets say somehow we figure it all out and we'reable to pump traffic through it
Other;so maybe that's a separate setting. in other words, the durationof each light you set it on, maybe 1 or 2 but the other one isimplied. because if this is green, then you cannot tell thesystem to make the other one green as well it just won'thappen. so you only set one, but the overlap of the red and theduration of the yellow is something you can set.
Other;so that'slike a final stage, how do you report the results
Other;so the form needs to be
Other;so there's lik
Other;so this can get fairly complex very fast because you have allthese intersections
Other;so we assume they have some sort of a pallet here where theygrab a road and they start dragging and then they drag that, sothere is some sort of drawing pallet right, that says okay i havethis thing i drag something, i'm drawing a road and i call itsomething and i draw and i call it b and i draw my roads andthen.
Other;"so what does ""it worked"" mean?"
Other;so why don't we start out
Other;so you don't have to
Other;so, like yousaid, if you click on here and double click on here then there'ssome form that lets you collect the information about thatintersection.
Other;soyou can mix and match
Other;t does seem like it would begood
Other;t has a computer, i would have to think about it reallyhard.
Other;talk through this with me
Other;that it would have tobe like flex or something
Other;that why i though
Other;that, and it also pushesit up to the road, so the road can aggregate, create the reportslater for all the intersections it has so we can aggregate thesething, so you can aggregate so you can get individualinformation on each car, on each intersection, on each road
Other;the distances, you know
Other;the intersection knows how many cars it has, and fullinventory of each car's direction, status, waiting, and waitingfor what.
Other;the left?hand turns are
Other;then i think
Other;then it makes it easier tokind of find it and it maps really closely to what you see overhere.
Other;there because doingit on the side can get kind of confusing
Other;there has to be
Other;there might be
Other;there was something about reducing wait?time and
Other;think
Other;think that
Other;this has to be like the main objec
Other;this is an approach
Other;want tostart off and say i have
Other;we
Other;we build a flex application
Other;we could have
Other;we could talk to the engineers too
Other;we have to be able to describe the behavior of thetraffic lights at each intersection.
Other;we haven't really,this is where we find some conflict
Other;we haven't yet worked thesensors
Other;we need to collect it as part of the approach to the intersection
Other;we still have to do thedetail design for how you specify these numbers
Other;well itdepends
Other;well, these are almost given
Other;what does ramming mean
Other;what does that mean? what isthe sensor sensoring? or detecting?
Other;with or without an optionto
Other;yeah, because that's a huge wrinkle if it's not.
Other;you can just give it a density andit just follows these rules
Other;you know, in some ways it seems
Other;you know, we should think about that
Other;you need some control with the flow
Other;you start simply.
Other;you'd set a rate
Other;you're completely just withdrawing the map
Other;because i mean if you're going
Other;especially withthe leftÇ-hand turn requirement
Other;i mean, the roads have a length
Other;i think, kind of the we would have to use[inaudible
Other;i thinkwe just go off the number of signals at each intersection.
Other;know it stops, it stopsnecessarily adding cars to this road,
Other;let's see what other
Other;think one thing is that the controls have to modify the signaltimings and the sensors so we basically got to just basically sayhere's
Other;think that at that point,we don't really care.
Other;think there's another thing you captured here. there'sthese inputs. and the road can actually have or, you know.
Other;think we can make that first clean division
Other;think, is the model on which to build the end userapplication.
Other;also, i mean it seems
Other;and it just tell them, hey full or heyi don't have any. so it's not it's own little thinking component.
Other;and it's significant because it holds anumber of cars.
Other;and then test it, are you full?
Other;and then you just have dictate people waiting for that turnare going to pile up as if it was straight
Other;aslong asÇ-also being able to control
Other;because all i'm saying it is, is basically you have a source
Other;because at that point the rules more apply to the intersectionitself as opposed to any one individual signal
Other;"because basically it's going to have given s1 goesgreen, it's going to have to delegate the actions of what s2 and s3are;"
Other;because eachintersection is going to have four
Other;because i could see they'd want to clickthe
Other;because i think really we care more about the signals at thatindividual intersection.
Other;because if there's a leftÇ-turn light, and they have straight light, aprotected left
Other;because if you have a light dictating left, it's always goingto be a left turn and straight and more often
Other;because i'm coming back to this now, becausetechnically our queue is
Other;because imean you could eventually be taken off theÇ-once you leave theroad
Other;because imean. there's a time element, because if the cars are stacking upat the intersection as opposed to free flowing in over twentyminutes.
Other;because it holds anumber of cars.
Other;because it seems like there should be a
Other;because it's really kind of thismeta
Other;because it'sgoing to have all the information it needs to know whether a carshould be continuing through or not
Other;because one lane isalways going, is always continuing through so if this is down toone lane you'd have one lane going straight, one lane feeding intothe leftÇ-hand turn, which is i mean i think it's fine
Other;because really all they're saying is to be able to change trafficdensity
Other;because that is reallygoing to affect the complexity of the problem and so,
Other;because thecars need to know how fast they can actually move with othercars in front of them.
Other;because thenyou have a way to connect up what each intersection connects upto and stuff.
Other;because there are two differenttimes.
Other;because there's aÇ-yeah that's what i was trying to
Other;because they said you know they need to be able to control theinput coming in. okay.
Other;because they should have two way traffic going betweentwoÇ-way intersections
Other;because this road is filling up,its queue is filling up, and it needs to drain
Other;because we canmake the assumption of just two lanes everywhere
Other;because, i mean, unless we care because given a certain road youcan have different lanes leading up to each intersection, it didn'treally
Other;becauseasÇ-if this road fills up, it's going to have to know i'm full
Other;"becausestraight, depending unless you're going to have an explicit rightturn lane, straight is going to have to worry about rights as well;they're in the same queue essentially. i'll just put right there iguess."
Other;direction. left, straight
Other;i could see a situation where you want to justÇ-you have xnumber of cars queued up, you say i'm going to stop this for nowbut you still want that throughÇ-put to go through even though ithasn't necessarily hit this intersection yet
Other;i guess that dependency is really comes back to the signals
Other;i guess the issues that are going to come into play are
Other;i mean with that they havetwo intersections coming to four turn lanes, i mean that's theproblem
Other;i think it's a simplification
Other;i think it's just more consistent
Other;i think it's more of a collection of signals because
Other;i think its more of the number of cars in period of time
Other;i think really we care more about
Other;i think that these are the only ones that should be toggable
Other;i think the road's going to have to be a little bit smarter
Other;i think theintersection's going toÇ-basically its interface is looking at that,its going to say road give me left cars, give me straight cars, giveme right cars
Other;i think there's aÇ-should be [inaudible] this if not just two fulllanes
Other;i think they're pretty straightÇ-forwardobjects
Other;i think those were the main big players
Other;i think we have
Other;i'm saying this is probably the best assumption
Other;i'm trying to think from how youwould actually manipulate this
Other;imean it comes back to this whole problem that we were toyingwith.
Other;imean they can't make a left
Other;i'mtrying to figure out how to capture the state of a car going down aspecific road
Other;it just consists of a set of intersectionsconnected
Other;it seems like a, for this type of problem a good first attack is justkind of a, you know a data analysis
Other;its going to be significant
Other;it's kind of a combination of clock and then there's also[inaudible
Other;it's two lanes, one of them
Other;just to get your thoughts.
Other;kind of a twice [inaudible
Other;kind of the situation of how they are physically doesn't matter,we just more care about what's leading up to it, and what it'sleading off to.
Other;sensorÇ-driven
Other;so how are these signalsÇ-trying to pull out our data
Other;so i think one of the things we'recoming out is the roadÇ-i don't know if it has lanes so much as ithas, you know left, straight, right.
Other;so it's interesting becausethe intersection has signals and the intersection has some controlof the signals.
Other;so let's go with the minimum so
Other;so maybe the data structure is set up where we don'tcare, i don't think we do care
Other;so we
Other;sounds like at each individual lane. on top of that,and being able to basically control the amount of cars goingthrough and certain flows in certain areas.
Other;that's the real scenario
Other;that's why i'm trying tothink, the lanes aren't necessarily so important as whichintersection does it get you to next
Other;the left turn really introduces a lot of problems
Other;the onlything the lanes are really going to affect is...how the lights affectus
Other;the problem is you can chop up lanes
Other;the problem with that is the variable path.
Other;the road would actually own what traffic it expects tobe traveling on it
Other;the signals. actual signals.
Other;the traffic wants to know.
Other;there's a time for each of those. tÇ-r, tÇ-yellow, tÇ-green
Other;there'stime,
Other;they have signals
Other;traffic
Other;we can say iÇ-
Other;we could play withthat. because these are the big state changes. yellow has nodifference really
Other;we don't want to get into
Other;we just more care about
Other;we might have multiple inputs and they're all going to have to sayhere's cars coming at you. and at that point the road justbecomes a queue and just keeps on popping on cars, and thenthey keep, they'll just pop off the queue.
Other;we might have to say add left caradd straight car, there might be more to the road i'm starting tothink.
Other;well it's a queue with a limit
Other;well it's more of a stops. it's more of a stops flow starts flow kindof thing
Other;what i'm wondering is that, is it one of thoseÇ-
Other;yeah i'm justÇ-do a flat file, sterilize it all
Other;you know, the leftcan go at the same time and then.
Other;i guess should be to have a look at congestion and see how many cars can actually get through during a certain amount of time
Other;i guess there needs to be a timer for
Other;i have traffic density can be changed.
Other;i think itís useful,
Other;i think the sensors are on the road rather connecting the intersections rather than on the intersection
Other;it could be that this is roads specific
Other;. you would have some kind of patterns for traffic lights, different ones which you will use on different intersections
Other;ah okay, road. we would have roads
Other;although for roads it would be a bit more tricky because i mean if we zoom in the sign that every road has two intersections, it doesnít fit, because at the edges of the map we have to have something else.
Other;at least a starting point and end point
Other;for me itís the traffic on a single road
Other;from my understanding it was like for the for the designer yes, the designer of the traffic just wants to define traffic either on the road or as input output for the system on endpoints,
Other;i donít see anything.
Other;i donít think that you want to redefine it for each intersection again and again if the timing is the same
Other;i guess it relates to if we should do this system level simulation or not, otherwise it doesnít make sense to have it.
Other;i guess the map can stay there
Other;i guess there should be some statistics in terms of like the total throughput of the system or something like that. runtime statistics
Other;i guess this four is representing what is required right now
Other;i guess timing behavior would be something in relation to traffic lights
Other;i guess we could do it as a hit map for the road in visualization mode
Other;i mean if we are going for a more model-view-controller pattern or something like that maybe we want to separate the visualization in some sense so that the visualization part would be, would have the play buttons and the simulations and all of that.
Other;i mean if you have an open ended road you should somehow be able to define that only one end should have an intersection and the other one should have not
Other;i mean the combination of possible roads would become a combinatorial exploration
Other;i mean the naÔve way to go about it would just start with a map and then assume that everything is a subset of a map.
Other;i mean they should contain information like density and optionally it may have speed limits and so on.
Other;i think we should then move to stages sooner or later
Other;i would like to use the abstraction level we have here at the requirement level
Other;i would say we have a visual item and that could be either road or traffic light or car
Other;iím just clarifying that there should be four traffic lights for each intersection, not a single one.
Other;iím just thinking about the different other possible use cases.
Other;it is: behavior can be defined at each intersection
Other;it would be road property i think
Other;maybe we can also move it. maybe itís possible, i can try
Other;maybe we donít even need a tool box
Other;maybe we just keep this in mind and then itís fine
Other;maybe we should clarify that and say that there should be one traffic light at each entry point into the intersection
Other;maybe we should clarify that each entry point into the intersection
Other;maybe you want to calculate exactly how long it takes for a single car to go from one end to the other end of the map or something like that
Other;mean we send it to be part of the intersection
Other;now i have another road and here is my first intersection. and now iím adding another road and here i have another intersection
Other;should we also include the velocity, the speed limits of the cars
Other;so i guess the visual map is to replay the simulation and the road layout is to create new simulations
Other;so i would expect some overall either 2-d or 3-d visualization where you can directly create your traffics and then you could push some button on saying simulate and maybe during the simulation at runtime you can also change some parts, like changing the traffic density, velocity or the traffic light behavior.
Other;so what i would like to have is some kind of traffic library
Other;speed limit i would say rather
Other;thatís just to kind of make it visually appealing in the map mode.
Other;the first one was for me that we need a visual map
Other;the first thing is only that everything is layouted. it could be also both but this is more detailed meaning that in this visual map. so the map at all i donít know how much details we have, but itís just the surrounding and base don that you can add roads.
Other;the timing behavior would be something related to traffic lights.
Other;then the next one was: there are optional sensors for car detection.
Other;there seems to be two moves
Other;this is a road. i added a road to the system
Other;to the roads, not the intersections
Other;we also need to look at how fast the cars are while crossing each intersection.
Other;we canít have an open ended intersections or open ended roads.
Other;we could do such a thing
Other;we could either now think about some technical aspects meaning for the visualization on the letís say more component diagram level which items do we need or maybe first of all we maybe make a class diagram for the different items, which should be represented by the software referencing to the requirements
Other;we could have some kind of input traffic, but the traffic is already designed per road
Other;we just use this part as a new road and this part as a new road
Other;we start with the plane map without any roads and then we can add some.
Other;what did i say? ìroad endpointsî, four and one. then we would have ìroadî
Other;yes maybe road traffic
Other;yes, how much in detail thatís something we can discuss
Other;you have the speed limit of the roads, but then also the velocity of the cars
Other;you should hopefully be able to see what the throughput is.
Other;also we have it on the laptop screen
Other;am trying to remember how thatís in real traffic
Other;because basically i mean, you could basically finish the
Other;because with the difficulties in the offset itís a bit problematic to draw this
Other;also before we draw again so first i can right now try to save the image
Other;another question is: which way the user can put a car onto the lane, as then there might be different starting points where cars can
Other;at the start of the road you can create new cars or define the number of cars, whether they want to, changing it during the simulation
Other;because for some reason i thought that by clicking the select button and selecting a part i would be able to move this selected part to some other place in the
Other;because i am not sure whether
Other;because i have basically forgot what was written
Other;because then it would be interesting to have like roads with the turning lanes and stuff and see how that affects the flow
Other;because then you can have a green wave for example
Other;because there is quite a lot of information we have to present somehow
Other;because we need a reference point.
Other;but i think we need for, do we need this for one intersection
Other;but that, yeah, i mean, thatís the thing, they will always work in pairs, it doesnít matter if it is 3 or 1, that have a car, just that itís, i mean north and south, or up and down
Other;erhaps we have somewhat, five seconds orange, 30 seconds green
Other;from other intersections
Other;i am thinking maybe we should have that in,
Other;i donít know, 10 cars per minute, or whatever way you want to define it then itís actually in this, in this certain interval it just produces new cars and shows new cars crossing the traffic lights, something like this
Other;i guess a common, atleast here in sweden is that the main road is always green if it doesnít detect anything coming from the crossing roads so the big road is always green but when thereís cars coming in from left or right it detects that and then it sets the main road to red so that they can join
Other;i guess we should have a play button for the simulation and when you hit that one, it starts with the one that is marked
Other;i mean if you should be able to create like green waves and stuff.
Other;i mean it would be more fun to have turning
Other;i mean must still identify it as an intersection
Other;i mean so every start of a road that has just starting is, i guess an entry point then and then you can set it on these, so here
Other;i think i read it somewhere, letís just assume that it was written somewhere
Other;i think i would actually, like something like this that you can put some points on this and i donít know, a car spawner or whatever and say click on it and the you say another one, another one, another one so that the user can basically decide, where to put it and create as many cars as he likes to
Other;i think perhaps we can
Other;i think the more interesting and the more challenging part is behavior of the traffic lights
Other;i would like this to be an intersection automatically
Other;it depends on how we want the users to interact with,
Other;letís see, combinations of individual signals should not be
Other;maybe itís enough to set those
Other;maybe we have a delay where nothing happens and then it just goes through the flow here and when that one is done it jumps to the up and down again, because as you said, up and down and left and right will be the same, right?
Other;mean depending on how it works, yeah, exactly, so do we have to prevent them to be both, they shouldnít be green at the same time, thatís an obvious one, but could they be orange at the same time but in different phases, one before it turns red and one before it turns green.
Other;mean the traffic lights look good now, i think
Other;mean what you could do is just control how long each of them are green and then the other one is gone be red automatically so then you can say ok this one is going to be green for, i donít know, whatís normal, but 20 seconds and this one is going to be green for 30 seconds and then they just go back and forth
Other;mean, this one turning red, that one that we were talking about, could trigger the flow in this one
Other;o maybe it should be, only enters at end of roads somewhere
Other;ok itís a bad idea to arrange it according to the direction of the lane
Other;ok you mean to achieve the green
Other;ok, so we do not have like a circle or like a closed system of streets but
Other;or should we just say here, here you just spawn cars, oh no, another way, here and here and here and here
Other;perhaps we could draw some simple examples of what it could look like.
Other;so i am thinking, how to represent the sequence because if you have it like that you can have like a box here or somewhere else which says, ok, this sequence is triggered by signal two becoming green.
Other;so i think perhaps we can just focus on the traffic light and the description of the behavior before we draw anything again
Other;so i think, whatís possible, correct me if you disCreative Conflict, it might be possible that there is no car on lane 1 and there are cars on lane 3, so just because no cars one lane 1 does mean that you can turn traffic light 2 to green, because if a car is at 3 then there might be an accident by this.
Other;so in this case it is like in 1 has no, 1 no car and three no car, so you can turn 2 and 4, i donít know, something like this.
Other;so once again before we can probably, or how is it done? we need to consider those, both traffic lights again so, so this one and this one, another simplified version
Other;so that one crossing does that one turn orange when they one going down to up when that one one turns red
Other;so the question is how they should interact with the traffic lights, i guess.
Other;so the question, we gonna have to think about when traffic light are turning orange
Other;so then i mean if you set the one going up and down, down and up, to be green for 30 seconds, orange for 10 then you know that the other one gonna be red for at least 40 if i remember the numbers i used.
Other;so this should be easy the main question here is i guess
Other;so we do not need to, the user doesnít need to draw a new kind of symbol as similar to the net but itís
Other;so we need to find a way to, for the user to describe the behavior
Other;so yo click on it and then you set that
Other;so you have a long road and each intersection will be green when the car arrives
Other;so, yeah, some way of indicating where it will start
Other;t they could just cross the traffic lights and also next to them
Other;that you define it in the user interface if you if you describe the behavior, perhaps like, i donít know. i mean it may just probably not, perhaps not a main for reference
Other;thatís, this was just how it is depicted by the, this was just a proposal for how it is depicted by the system
Other;the last sentence of the fourth point
Other;the question is whether
Other;the question is whether we could give this to our advantage
Other;then letís say that maybe there is a delay before the other starts it sequence being orange and then
Other;then our system would need to detect this and put, i guess, switch this to, i donít know, orange or, i think itís a problem that you could draw, this problems my draw, something was wrong before, so we would probably need to change this to red light and then this to orange or green and this switching right.
Other;then you can say that ok this sequence is triggered by this signal turning green for example so when this other turns green then the sequence will go and then you can have
Other;we could actually draw some kind of car symbol there
Other;we just have to, like one traffic light at the beginning, something like this. so then we know for sure that the first car can drive up here, so some other car can also for 35 seconds at least.
Other;we need to assume some kind of absolute time
Other;we need to make sure that the traffic light to the right
Other;we need to make sure that this cannot happen.
Other;we say 45 and then i donít know, maybe we set orange afterwards as well, so this is that one that this, that one we talked about first, the one going down and up, when that one is red, this flow triggers, so it just goes back and forth and then maybe as you said
Other;with the green wave.
Other;yeah, main or start or whatever
Other;yeah, so maybe we should draw it a little bit bigger, i mean because there is quite a lot of information we have to present somehow.
Other;yeah, so this should be always be shown on the bottom in this way here.
Other;yes, a minimap
Other;you should be able to say how many cars per or something it should create
Other;howcongested is it?
Other;and that would be what?
Other;so what basic data structures are we looking at here?
Other;what elsedo we have
Other;what would this guy have?
Other;and where do you see
Other;are there other objects?
Other;but does it have only lefthand?
Other;distances, and density relate to it?
Other;he second?
Other;how do you know who's waiting and why
Other;that green is on?
Other;then, what was the information wehad
Other;what are the goals, and how are they set
Other;where was the part where there was something about waittime
Other;does it say anything about the number of lanes?
Other;how do we?
Other;is there a leftÇ-turn lane, or is it a suicide left?
Other;so nowcome back up, what big concepts haven't we captured yet
Other;what are we seeing here
Other;whatproperties of roads we have to worry about
Other;do we have something in vision
Other;are you writing anything right now?
Other;do you have other points regarding what you can design on the map?
Other;do you have something else?
Other;how do we continue based on that?
Other;how do you know where one road starts and where one ends?
Other;is this something which is defined in the task or do you think itís just optional we could add it?
Other;okay, so visual map would be houses and the cars travelling on the road and so on?
Other;so what was the question?
Other;the only thing that is actually set is the density per road what would that view contain?
Other;the question is what do you want to do as a designer?
Other;the question is what is a road?
Other;what is it?
Other;what more do we have as part of the intersection?
Other;what was it
Other;what was it?
Other;what was your point?
Other;where did you write?
Other;yes, so anything else?
Other;you asked if we have another attribute for intersection?
Other;you mean each traffic light?
Other;do we have something in vision
Other;are you writing anything right now?
Other;do you have other points regarding what you can design on the map?
Other;do you have something else?
Other;how do we continue based on that?
Other;how do you know where one road starts and where one ends?
Other;is this something which is defined in the task or do you think itís just optional we could add it?
Other;okay, so visual map would be houses and the cars travelling on the road and so on?
Other;so what was the question?
Other;the only thing that is actually set is the density per road what would that view contain?
Other;the question is what do you want to do as a designer?
Other;the question is what is a road?
Other;what is it?
Other;what more do we have as part of the intersection?
Other;what was it
Other;what was it?
Other;what was your point?
Other;where did you write?
Other;yes, so anything else?
Other;you asked if we have another attribute for intersection?
Other;you mean each traffic light?
Other;do we have to do something
Other;because
Other;because you would have to moveseveral blocks at the same time.
Other;do we really have an actual intersection as an item or is it just indirectly given if you do an intersection?
Other;is it currently disturbing
Other;is it mentioned in the task or do you just think it would be useful?
Other;. a cop is kind of controlling the state of the model
Other;also don't need to push on herebecause the--this, you don't need to randomly push on herebecause all the cars coming in this queue are going to becoming from this road. either from here, or from there.
Other;although i mean theoretically you could do somethinglike this
Other;because cars into this road can come from here goingstraight, here turning left, or here turning right
Other;because each road can have adifferent rate.
Other;because i think one of the goals here is tocommunicate this to
Other;because i'm having trouble
Other;because i'm thinking
Other;because it can't turn ifthe road in the opposite has cars in it.
Other;because it kind of applies
Other;because it's the cop that's receiving the tick, right?
Other;because let'ssuppose we make it so every
Other;because now as you drag thisone over you've got to make sure to drag that one over
Other;because roads kind of come in pairs as faras we're concerned
Other;because that might be avariable way of entering
Other;because that then really shows the success of the networkoverall
Other;because that's a way tothen, you know that's a way to sort
Other;because that'sthe queue for the light.
Other;because the popping logic, you can't pop ifthe other road is full
Other;because the simulation is supposed to be not just one
Other;because thenwho's responsible for coordinating.
Other;because they've got to be
Other;because we have directional graph andwe have [inaudible] and dopplets of what's a valid graph
Other;because we're not supposed to have t-êjunctionswe're supposed to have...
Other;because you could also, imean, theoretically you could also have an intersectionwhere this goes left and straight and this is just red.
Other;because your'e talking abouta kind of combination of a rule and an action,
Other;because, forinstance if this
Other;because--so anyway we go through the intersection
Other;because--this would be interesting things tosimulate.
Other;it seems like maybe, because then you have to then it'sseparate then you have to do them in sync. so maybe it'sreally a function of the result of how the intersections arelaid out. and the relationship between the intersection
Other;it sort of seems like it is appropriate because a copneeds to look at the top of the queue, or needs to look at thetop of the queue to see what kind of car it is
Other;it's an interior road if anotherroad--because this says you're going in here and out here sois this--is an interior road just one queue or in general
Other;one thing we could simplify is, in order to get--because thismatters
Other;the classjust gets huge and you end up [inaudible] it. but yeah, i likethe [inaudible
Other;therandom number generator could saturate the space on theroads.
Other;well capacity is a good one to have because then you canevaluate wait time per
Other;well it seems like a lot of the logic is going to be--a lot of thecomplication is going to be in the push and pop actions
Other;where it could be going. and theseare basically, these better be pointing
Other;you can't pick up thisintersection, it would make sense to move the entire road
Other;and that's my point
Other;becaues
Other;because in real life some intersections you cannot.
Other;because it knows where it's going
Other;because thatjust made it complex
Other;because the road knows about intersections, and then thewhole map.
Other;becauseas you start adjusting here it would go here as you wouldósoyou can almost go infinite here so it has to, you just give it.
Other;becauseotherwise
Other;becausethat'd
Other;but
Other;but its not necessary
Other;cause there's a lot of complexity
Other;hat's going to cause traffic problems here.
Other;i mean
Other;i mean, we have to state this because if it's notó
Other;if
Other;in the real world, you know, a can becurving and intersect 1 three times, and do an s and dead?end.
Other;is the traffic kind ofóyou know how some you havegreen one way but not on the other.
Other;like during commuting hours everyoneworks over there, but the shopping center is down there, so onweekends everyone is going that way.
Other;o professor e says,this is your exam this is your project, here is a traffic pattern,this is the grid, what is the optimal traffic light settings? figurethat out. and so how do you, you know, and again i think itwould be up to the customer, the professor, in this case, tospecify what optimal means, what is allowed wait?time, howmany traffic, you know people waiting on the lights, right, all ofthat.
Other;so
Other;so maybe that's a separate setting. in other words, the durationof each light you set it on, maybe 1 or 2 but the other one isimplied. because if this is green, then you cannot tell thesystem to make the other one green as well it just won'thappen. so you only set one, but the overlap of the red and theduration of the yellow is something you can set.
Other;so this can get fairly complex very fast because you have allthese intersections
Other;so you don't have to
Other;soyou can mix and match
Other;that why i though
Other;then it makes it easier tokind of find it and it maps really closely to what you see overhere.
Other;there because doingit on the side can get kind of confusing
Other;we
Other;we could talk to the engineers too
Other;well itdepends
Other;well, these are almost given
Other;yeah, because that's a huge wrinkle if it's not.
Other;because i mean if you're going
Other;especially withthe leftÇ-hand turn requirement
Other;because all i'm saying it is, is basically you have a source
Other;because at that point the rules more apply to the intersectionitself as opposed to any one individual signal
Other;"because basically it's going to have given s1 goesgreen, it's going to have to delegate the actions of what s2 and s3are;"
Other;because eachintersection is going to have four
Other;because i could see they'd want to clickthe
Other;because i think really we care more about the signals at thatindividual intersection.
Other;because if there's a leftÇ-turn light, and they have straight light, aprotected left
Other;because if you have a light dictating left, it's always goingto be a left turn and straight and more often
Other;because i'm coming back to this now, becausetechnically our queue is
Other;because imean you could eventually be taken off theÇ-once you leave theroad
Other;because imean. there's a time element, because if the cars are stacking upat the intersection as opposed to free flowing in over twentyminutes.
Other;because it holds anumber of cars.
Other;because it seems like there should be a
Other;because it's really kind of thismeta
Other;because it'sgoing to have all the information it needs to know whether a carshould be continuing through or not
Other;because one lane isalways going, is always continuing through so if this is down toone lane you'd have one lane going straight, one lane feeding intothe leftÇ-hand turn, which is i mean i think it's fine
Other;because really all they're saying is to be able to change trafficdensity
Other;because that is reallygoing to affect the complexity of the problem and so,
Other;because thecars need to know how fast they can actually move with othercars in front of them.
Other;because thenyou have a way to connect up what each intersection connects upto and stuff.
Other;because there are two differenttimes.
Other;because there's aÇ-yeah that's what i was trying to
Other;because they said you know they need to be able to control theinput coming in. okay.
Other;because they should have two way traffic going betweentwoÇ-way intersections
Other;because this road is filling up,its queue is filling up, and it needs to drain
Other;because we canmake the assumption of just two lanes everywhere
Other;because, i mean, unless we care because given a certain road youcan have different lanes leading up to each intersection, it didn'treally
Other;becauseasÇ-if this road fills up, it's going to have to know i'm full
Other;"becausestraight, depending unless you're going to have an explicit rightturn lane, straight is going to have to worry about rights as well;they're in the same queue essentially. i'll just put right there iguess."
Other;just to get your thoughts.
Other;so it's interesting becausethe intersection has signals and the intersection has some controlof the signals.
Other;that's why i'm trying tothink, the lanes aren't necessarily so important as whichintersection does it get you to next
Other;we could play withthat. because these are the big state changes. yellow has nodifference really
Other;i guess this four is representing what is required right now
Other;iím just thinking about the different other possible use cases.
Other;maybe we donít even need a tool box
Other;thatís just to kind of make it visually appealing in the map mode.
Other;we just use this part as a new road and this part as a new road
Other;because basically i mean, you could basically finish the
Other;because with the difficulties in the offset itís a bit problematic to draw this
Other;because for some reason i thought that by clicking the select button and selecting a part i would be able to move this selected part to some other place in the
Other;because i am not sure whether
Other;because i have basically forgot what was written
Other;because then it would be interesting to have like roads with the turning lanes and stuff and see how that affects the flow
Other;because then you can have a green wave for example
Other;because there is quite a lot of information we have to present somehow
Other;because we need a reference point.
Other;so then i mean if you set the one going up and down, down and up, to be green for 30 seconds, orange for 10 then you know that the other one gonna be red for at least 40 if i remember the numbers i used.
Other;the last sentence of the fourth point
Other;it should bepossible to create a busy road or a seldom used one, or any 0variation in between.
Other;so that'scase one, that's case one. case two would be we've got aleft-êhand turn and we're either yellow or
Other;, that's the complication that arises when you allowthat, is you have to figure out how it's--
Other;and as well as the signal.
Other;and it also corresponds to time
Other;and so the copsays okay, i try to tick, the intersections says i'm still or thatlight says i'm still green, and let's suppose this guy has rulessaying every four ticks change the colors of the lights.
Other;and the fact that we can't have a t-êjunction keeps us fromdoing things like that, right
Other;controls
Other;directional -- okay. i'm thinking this is a queue, this is aqueue, this a queue.
Other;evaluation should be, should we say areable to evaluate per intersection or per
Other;i want to evaluate success of each simulation.
Other;i'm thinking, yeah, i'm thinking in terms of model-êviewcontroller
Other;it's almost like you just step up a level and have anobject called a network and that's the thing that assemblesintersection out of roads and knows whether its an exteriorroad or an interior road and all that
Other;it's coming together though, i think. it's just more rules.
Other;it's going
Other;it's not going to work. that's
Other;it's really a geometric property of the road
Other;my first inclination is to say, okay the rules if rules can getpushed into the objects and then tick maybe into the--distribute the rules into the network and then at every tickeach aspect, each car gets a tick, each intersection gets atick, each road gets a tick.
Other;my initial thinking was you'd have intersection object thatcontained four roads they're all incoming roads
Other;now we're looking at this visually is thisnotion of speed of the car through a particular road
Other;say some number of cars per minute while the lights green.
Other;so intersection then we need car, we need the notionof time, this is a simulation of time
Other;so maybe a drawing of a, the simplest intersection, right, andan intersection, and have a particular road would have -ê it'sdirectional on either side, right. there are some number ofcars flowing on a particular road waiting at an intersection.there is a clock, right, that governs when the lights change.so, there are lights, right. this goes across the street rightthere.
Other;so the frequency f here is not a global to the network, it's asetting on a particular onramp road.
Other;so two things: design and interaction
Other;so we have to have some sort of timer model that
Other;so, one thing wehaven't talked about is how we in queue a car.
Other;so, yeah i guess at a very base level we kick everything offwith main( ). right
Other;somehow we need to represent the amount of trafficor traffic flow
Other;that's another thing is thelight
Other;the lane would be an addition of the road with somespecific logic data.
Other;then what we're really trying to do isminimize the wait time
Other;this is a queue and what we're reallyinterested in is how those cars queue up, how big the queuesget, when the queues release and how many we can pop-êupthe end of the queue for some given clock tick. then we cankeep speed constant for
Other;this is starting to sound very--i mean i can already see thelength of the source file for the car
Other;we have some constraints on the flow of the queuesbecause we can't have lights coming in a collision course.
Other;we need something that represents intersections.
Other;we should talk about road, got this modelcontrol
Other;where you put these roads determines how the queue,the maximum number of cars in an intersection
Other;and then there's some way to
Other;but jim did we finish with the cars kind of
Other;but you know that you brought up a point you know
Other;i think it's just saying
Other;i think wehave to talk to professor e again, because she didn't specify themost important aspect of it, which is how do you know thatyour lighting system is working to its best potential? i candraw the map, i can specify all these parameters and now i runit, how do i know this is good
Other;i think we're going to have to rely on professor e forcreating the details about the theory of how that works. i mean,we might have to code whatever her understanding is of trafficlight theory into it
Other;i want to do
Other;i'm thinking
Other;is there a sensor?'
Other;it didn't sound like you need control at the individual carlevel
Other;let's start coding
Other;like it could be like
Other;of course we're not going and talking to her, we're going to talkto the team of software developers
Other;okay, i say i want fifty cars on the grid, but i don't want themall going the same way.
Other;one thing that we're kind of missing there
Other;should not allow
Other;so i would start simple, jim.
Other;so let's build
Other;so let's just say for
Other;so lets say somehow we figure it all out and we'reable to pump traffic through it
Other;so that'slike a final stage, how do you report the results
Other;so the form needs to be
Other;"so what does ""it worked"" mean?"
Other;t has a computer, i would have to think about it reallyhard.
Other;talk through this with me
Other;that it would have tobe like flex or something
Other;the distances, you know
Other;the left?hand turns are
Other;there has to be
Other;want tostart off and say i have
Other;we have to be able to describe the behavior of thetraffic lights at each intersection.
Other;we haven't yet worked thesensors
Other;we need to collect it as part of the approach to the intersection
Other;we still have to do thedetail design for how you specify these numbers
Other;what does ramming mean
Other;what does that mean? what isthe sensor sensoring? or detecting?
Other;with or without an optionto
Other;you can just give it a density andit just follows these rules
Other;you start simply.
Other;you're completely just withdrawing the map
Other;know it stops, it stopsnecessarily adding cars to this road,
Other;let's see what other
Other;and it's significant because it holds anumber of cars.
Other;and then you just have dictate people waiting for that turnare going to pile up as if it was straight
Other;direction. left, straight
Other;i could see a situation where you want to justÇ-you have xnumber of cars queued up, you say i'm going to stop this for nowbut you still want that throughÇ-put to go through even though ithasn't necessarily hit this intersection yet
Other;i'm trying to think from how youwould actually manipulate this
Other;it just consists of a set of intersectionsconnected
Other;its going to be significant
Other;it's kind of a combination of clock and then there's also[inaudible
Other;it's two lanes, one of them
Other;sensorÇ-driven
Other;so how are these signalsÇ-trying to pull out our data
Other;so we
Other;sounds like at each individual lane. on top of that,and being able to basically control the amount of cars goingthrough and certain flows in certain areas.
Other;the left turn really introduces a lot of problems
Other;the onlything the lanes are really going to affect is...how the lights affectus
Other;the problem is you can chop up lanes
Other;the problem with that is the variable path.
Other;the road would actually own what traffic it expects tobe traveling on it
Other;the signals. actual signals.
Other;there'stime,
Other;they have signals
Other;traffic
Other;we don't want to get into
Other;we just more care about
Other;we might have multiple inputs and they're all going to have to sayhere's cars coming at you. and at that point the road justbecomes a queue and just keeps on popping on cars, and thenthey keep, they'll just pop off the queue.
Other;well it's a queue with a limit
Other;well it's more of a stops. it's more of a stops flow starts flow kindof thing
Other;i guess should be to have a look at congestion and see how many cars can actually get through during a certain amount of time
Other;i have traffic density can be changed.
Other;ah okay, road. we would have roads
Other;although for roads it would be a bit more tricky because i mean if we zoom in the sign that every road has two intersections, it doesnít fit, because at the edges of the map we have to have something else.
Other;i donít think that you want to redefine it for each intersection again and again if the timing is the same
Other;i guess we could do it as a hit map for the road in visualization mode
Other;i think we should then move to stages sooner or later
Other;i would like to use the abstraction level we have here at the requirement level
Other;it is: behavior can be defined at each intersection
Other;so i guess the visual map is to replay the simulation and the road layout is to create new simulations
Other;so i would expect some overall either 2-d or 3-d visualization where you can directly create your traffics and then you could push some button on saying simulate and maybe during the simulation at runtime you can also change some parts, like changing the traffic density, velocity or the traffic light behavior.
Other;so what i would like to have is some kind of traffic library
Other;speed limit i would say rather
Other;the first one was for me that we need a visual map
Other;then the next one was: there are optional sensors for car detection.
Other;there seems to be two moves
Other;this is a road. i added a road to the system
Other;we also need to look at how fast the cars are while crossing each intersection.
Other;we canít have an open ended intersections or open ended roads.
Other;we could either now think about some technical aspects meaning for the visualization on the letís say more component diagram level which items do we need or maybe first of all we maybe make a class diagram for the different items, which should be represented by the software referencing to the requirements
Other;we start with the plane map without any roads and then we can add some.
Other;you have the speed limit of the roads, but then also the velocity of the cars
Other;you should hopefully be able to see what the throughput is.
Conversation Management;then the next one was: there are optional sensors for car detection.
Conversation Management;there seems to be two moves
Conversation Management;this is a road. i added a road to the system
Conversation Management;we also need to look at how fast the cars are while crossing each intersection.
Conversation Management;we canít have an open ended intersections or open ended roads.

Conversation Management;you have the speed limit of the roads, but then also the velocity of the cars
Conversation Management;you should hopefully be able to see what the throughput is.
Conversation Management;another question is: which way the user can put a car onto the lane, as then there might be different starting points where cars can
Conversation Management;i mean if you should be able to create like green waves and stuff.
Conversation Management;i mean must still identify it as an intersection
Conversation Management;i think i read it somewhere, letís just assume that it was written somewhere
Conversation Management;letís see, combinations of individual signals should not be
Conversation Management;mean what you could do is just control how long each of them are green and then the other one is gone be red automatically so then you can say ok this one is going to be green for, i donít know, whatís normal, but 20 seconds and this one is going to be green for 30 seconds and then they just go back and forth
Conversation Management;perhaps we could draw some simple examples of what it could look like.
Conversation Management;so the question is how they should interact with the traffic lights, i guess.
Conversation Management;so the question, we gonna have to think about when traffic light are turning orange
Conversation Management;so this should be easy the main question here is i guess
Conversation Management;so we need to find a way to, for the user to describe the behavior
Conversation Management;the question is whether
Conversation Management;the question is whether we could give this to our advantage
Conversation Management;we need to assume some kind of absolute time
Conversation Management;we need to make sure that the traffic light to the right
Conversation Management;we need to make sure that this cannot happen.
Conversation Management;yeah, so maybe we should draw it a little bit bigger, i mean because there is quite a lot of information we have to present somehow.
Conversation Management;yeah, so this should be always be shown on the bottom in this way here.
Conversation Management;ah, i see
Conversation Management;i see
Conversation Management;i see.
Conversation Management;oh, i see what you're saying
Conversation Management;oh, i see what you're saying, uh huh. okay.
Conversation Management;i understand what you mean
Conversation Management;7right?
Conversation Management;a queue of cars.
Conversation Management;a specific car?
Conversation Management;does that seem reasonable?
Conversation Management;goes from blue to orange right?
Conversation Management;i want to basically i want to controlaspects of the intersection
Conversation Management;intersection?
Conversation Management;is that true?3well
Conversation Management;is that what your saying
Conversation Management;okay?
Conversation Management;once again, it's per tick right
Conversation Management;one car per tick
Conversation Management;onramp right?
Conversation Management;pretty simple guy though right
Conversation Management;right
Conversation Management;right.
Conversation Management;right?
Conversation Management;toanalytics right?
Conversation Management;yeah,
Conversation Management;and this is a real?time table?
Conversation Management;are you saying there's actually a car out there
Conversation Management;but not every car that starts at c would do that?
Conversation Management;did it saythat?
Conversation Management;how do you report the final results?
Conversation Management;i'm sorry
Conversation Management;probably need to talk to professor e alittle more about that.
Conversation Management;put it up there.
Conversation Management;so it has four approaches at most?
Conversation Management;so you want to leave one of these constant and change theother.
Conversation Management;this is cars?
Conversation Management;want to draw something?
Conversation Management;what i would do is
Conversation Management;you can buildmultiple simulations on this map
Conversation Management;you know?
Conversation Management;you say, i want 50 cars like this.
Conversation Management;you think?
Conversation Management;do we care?
Conversation Management;do we really want that
Conversation Management;is it safe from stuff like that
Conversation Management;is that really the only thing?
Conversation Management;kind of?
Conversation Management;really
Conversation Management;so can you hit all the green
Conversation Management;this is on the road isn't it
Conversation Management;well?
Conversation Management;does that fit to you view as well?
Conversation Management;a sketch for the interface?
Conversation Management;again sorry for my handwriting
Conversation Management;ah sorry
Conversation Management;but we have the roads.
Conversation Management;did you remove it?
Conversation Management;do you understand my point?
Conversation Management;do you want to do it or should i continue?
Conversation Management;do you want to model as use case?
Conversation Management;have you seen what iím drawing on my side?
Conversation Management;how much time is left? 10.30?
Conversation Management;huh? road traffic?
Conversation Management;i start with a map?
Conversation Management;iím sorry about my handwriting
Conversation Management;is it okay in that state?
Conversation Management;is it okay?
Conversation Management;is my handwriting okay?
Conversation Management;is that big enough?
Conversation Management;is that okay?
Conversation Management;maybe just call it tool box or something like that
Conversation Management;really?
Conversation Management;remove everything
Conversation Management;right? is that correct?
Conversation Management;should i start?
Conversation Management;should we do a drawing for that or
Conversation Management;should we draw it in detail or do we just make a statement on what we have, what needs to be visualized, the roads, the traffic lights and the cars
Conversation Management;sorry
Conversation Management;sorry for my handwriting
Conversation Management;sorry i have
Conversation Management;sorry.
Conversation Management;sorry?
Conversation Management;that will be the timing scheme?
Conversation Management;then i remove the drawings of the roads?
Conversation Management;we could do just a mock up if you like
Conversation Management;what am i doing wrong?
Conversation Management;which is if we go to the visual item and have the map is okay, isnít it?
Conversation Management;why we move the intersection you mean?
Conversation Management;would that be okay?
Conversation Management;you can read it?
Conversation Management;you mean each traffic light?
Conversation Management;you see my line?
Conversation Management;you want me to try? okay
Conversation Management;alright?
Conversation Management;because orange is both, preparing to start, well how does it work, and then it is also hinting that soon it will be red, right?
Conversation Management;but do you mean like this?
Other;but they will always be the same, right?
Other;can you remember, did the task description say something concerning this
Other;did you hear rodi?
Other;did you turn of the screen recording?
Other;do you get what i mean?
Other;i am sorry for this ugly appearance
Other;i was thinking if we should have triggers as you said i mean of the signals.
Other;is it right?
Other;no, no go ahead.
Other;ok?
Other;or what do you think?
Other;perhaps you can do the intersections
Other;right
Other;right?
Other;shall i give it a try?
Other;should be able to set that one?
Other;so i am sorry for that
Other;so we keep that?
Other;so you mean if the user uses the intersection symbol, then it would automatically create the traffic light in a specific way.
Other;sorry
Other;ulation, i mean, letís just assume that, to safe some complicity that we will start with, that we only have this simple intersection and we start the simulation and this car makes this and there is no car, it would actually start with a green fix at this traffic light, right?
Other;with the sensors or?
Other;with this slidebar at the bottom, or so something like this
Other;you know what i mean?
Other;you mean that user doesnít have to draw it anyway, but that the software would detect it and then say ok, you draw an intersection, i will add traffic lights on my own
Other;. i guess we can erase these, this now.
Other;how much longer?
Other;so that's okay?
Other;yeah, they're there. there's something about the light, eachlight has some kind of timing settings.
Other;but then i can also the delete the selected part and not everything.
Other;do you know this, rodi, do you know that, currently certain parts are selected in purple. is this the selected part for the smartboard?
Other;ok
Other;perhaps, rodi, you can answer this question: i would like to select this part on the right hand side, the streets and so and move this to the left hand side. is this possible here?
Other;rodi, andreas just asked me, or just said to me that i should ask you how long we still have for this, cause i think officially it is more or less over in, i donít know five minutes
Other;thank you very much
Other;yeah, thank you
Other;it's basically, yeah, i mean you can think of, it's aperson
Other;it's like okay i'vebeen in this state
Other;got it. alright
Other;i like that.
Other;it's the god alright, it's the master controller
Other;oh, that's right, the speed of simulation
Other;right, yeah
Other;that's true, that's true. okay
Other;well i like what you're saying, i like the idea
Other;well that's a good point, though,
Other;well, let's establish the rules
Other;yeah that sounds more realistic.
Other;yeah. i like that.
Other;and it's a very kind of recursive problem
Other;definitely
Other;i wouldn't want
Other;if i move this, how does it change this
Other;it's nice in the simulation to be able to watch what'sgoing on here
Other;oh right, so they could be different
Other;on this map.
Other;that would be very awkward
Other;that's true
Other;that's what i was going to say, yeah
Other;that's what i was saying
Other;when jim is present, only jim does the board, as you see hishand?writing, his ability to use markers is remarkable, so noone approaches the board, he's very good.
Other;yeah that makes sense
Other;, that makes a lot of sense
Other;a queue with a limit
Other;ahh that's brilliant
Other;because you're right
Other;cool, cool. sounds good
Other;cool, i like that
Other;exactly
Other;exactly, exactly.
Other;exactly, yeah exactly.
Other;excellent, excellent.
Other;good question.
Other;i like that. cool.
Other;interesting
Other;interesting question
Other;it does, yeah
Other;makes sense.
Other;sure, yeah, yeah.
Other;that fit, so
Other;that fit.
Other;that is a great point
Other;that makes sense
Other;that's interesting
Other;that's the perfect simplification.
Other;that's what i'm trying to figure out.
Other;yeah, exactly.
Other;should make it much easier, youíre right
Other;alright, yes, sure
Other;fair enough.
Other;i think itís a good and great idea
Other;i think itís a good idea
Other;same thing here
Other;so i usually start with a data model, so a class diagram is probably a good idea
Other;sure.
Other;thatís a good point
Other;thatís fine
Other;we need to do one of the representations meaning thatÖ i mean you are right on the loose ends, i Creative Conflict on that
Other;yes i Creative Conflict. great
Other;yes thatís a good idea.
Other;yes thatís fine.
Other;yes, for sure
Other;yes, i think itís a good idea
Other;i mean, i am not sure whether it is perhaps done differently in different countries, but i think at least what i am used to is that it would be on the lefthand side
Other;i think thatís the most interesting way, to see the individual cars
Other;it was written in the requirements, i think, i read it somewhere
Other;ok, to visualise it, how busy it is
Other;so for instance and the traffic light on the, for the, for this car, that specifies something like 20 seconds green and i donít know, other delays for orange and red and accordingly for the other ones
Other;that would be the most fun i think,
Other;would be basically that we donít say, after 30 or 50 and then you have to take in account, ok, then does this one go to green and then does this one go to green and then does this one go to green,
Other;yeah, thatís a good point
Other;and have uml diagram for the class structureof each object's attributes
Other;so maybe once we've done that we can thinkabout uml diagrams for our class structures
Other;you mean the actual data structures?
Other;erdiagram
Other;i kind of want to build an er diagram
Other;Ö we should have some description on how is the interaction with the system which you could also do via use case,
Other;do we also go on some behavioral aspects
Other;letís say more component diagram level
Other;maybe first of all we maybe make a class diagram
Other;maybe we draw this and then we make a component diagram sketch
Other;so i usually start with a data model, so a class diagram is probably a good idea
Other;some use cases or something like that
Other;it should bepossible to create a busy road or a seldom used one, or any 0variation in between.
Other;or, at leastde
Other;. which would be a horizontalflow or a vertical flow
Other;aroad is an interior or we should call it an onramp
Other;cop, we'd have kind of a cop object that youcould manipulate certain rule sets. or is that implicit in[inaudible
Other;do you want to keep it or do you want to do two queues.
Other;is the cop really a model or is that acontroller
Other;is this all this sort of master control orwhatever? or should that go into where you push rulesdown to
Other;it has a tick, tick, tick, or are we saying that alltick logic methods have a combo
Other;it might be, or another alternative
Other;now i'm wondering like the rule for changing the lights,we established a rule saying the light, are we going to saylight would change to green, or will only stay red for xamount of time, or is it reversed
Other;okayone tick so from two to one, we go to zero
Other;one car or two
Other;or a left protection
Other;or analyzing the average wait time of a given car, right
Other;or are all the opposing lanesalways the same state
Other;or are we lettingthe video camera capture that description
Other;or if
Other;or if we
Other;or is this inside of a ui
Other;or we could even have
Other;or yeah i guess speed of cars, rate of incoming cars onthe onramp
Other;or you could say
Other;or you could start from the outside in and say, well for everyunbounded road,
Other;or you've got
Other;or, i want to run it on--run a simulation for some amount oftime and evaluate the network
Other;or, wait. well that's [inaudible] one cargoes per tick.
Other;property of the queue or a property of thecar
Other;so we makeroads, right. so one m of intersections and we would haveroad connected to the intersection or the intersection has2paths
Other;somenumber of--so it has, think of this as kilometers, or carlengths.
Other;this way, or that way
Other;ticks per minute, orsecond. okay
Other;we could do it that way. either that or we could make roadsdominant and then intersections really just a thing thathappens at road crossings.
Other;although
Other;although wemight duplicate that down here so that they can keep track ofit
Other;and what kind of metrics or ideas does she have aroundsuccess or failure of a given, of a simulation
Other;ayout on here well i definitely want itred for this whole period, and definitely red while it's yellow,and then there should be a little bit of an overlap. maybesomething tha
Other;but i think
Other;but the thing is
Other;cars are independent ofintersections i feel
Other;each approach has a different light, or we could putthem in pairs where the north and south approaches both havethe same light signals.
Other;i'm saying
Other;or
Other;or maybe allow cycleable defaults
Other;or, again we could
Other;or, it could be you can drawwhile you're simulating.
Other;so maybe that's a separate setting.
Other;well, by controlling it at an individual car level you end upcontrolling the flow
Other;you have to have green arrow and red arrow
Other;do the roads delegate this, or do the intersections delegate all thecommunication
Other;does it run on a clock or does
Other;is it a push or a pull model with the intersections
Other;it's getting down to push or pull
Other;mean if you think of, you know desktop or
Other;one signal perdirection at each intersection. could be
Other;or do we just assume that anything doesn'thaveÇ-
Other;or intersection is going tohave to say something. okay, cars can come, and then the roadsare going to have to
Other;or is thatÇ-
Other;or is this thetime between state changes
Other;or, i'mgoing to have a left
Other;other option is to make it a full two second lane
Other;put them in, or pull them out
Other;sense to me or just basically
Other;so basically leftor straight depending on the car.
Other;you know, or input
Other;i mean it could be one or two i guess
Other;and then we had the road endpoint which could either be a real endpoint or it could be an intersection
Other;and through the road endpoint it has one, two, four, Ö is possible, fourteen is not good
Other;and we either have a real intersection or we have an end point
Other;do we want to make it easy and just have density as part of the road or do we want to make something more sophisticated in terms of traffic models.
Other;i mean another alternative would be to just have something like a default timing which you can change
Other;if the traffic model should be completely separate entity here, which relates to the map or if we should just make it easier just make the roads have a simple density.
Other;it could be open ended, it could be, i guess anything. a house or something
Other;so we have to choose, one of them has to be open ended so to speak.
Other;t could be either a real endpoint or an intersection
Other;this makes the calculation more complicated, but on the other hand itís something like if we donít want to design or define traffic per road which is one of the tasks or requirements.
Other;and through the road endpoint it has one, two, four, Ö is possible, fourteen is not good
Other;and we either have a real intersection or we have an end point
Other;do we want to make it easy and just have density as part of the road or do we want to make something more sophisticated in terms of traffic models.
Other;i mean another alternative would be to just have something like a default timing which you can change
Other;if the traffic model should be completely separate entity here, which relates to the map or if we should just make it easier just make the roads have a simple density.
Other;it could be open ended, it could be, i guess anything. a house or something
Other;so we have to choose, one of them has to be open ended so to speak.
Other;t could be either a real endpoint or an intersection
Other;this makes the calculation more complicated, but on the other hand itís something like if we donít want to design or define traffic per road which is one of the tasks or requirements.
Other;and so, or sequences or more than one traffic
Other;but
Other;but does the user need to be able to define in our simplified version?
Other;but thatís what i meant with my circles
Other;i didnít take it into account that it says that enters the map on a given road, so but then itís probably better to do like this at the start of the road or at the end of the road,
Other;i mean the easiest way is to just have as you said, timings
Other;i was just thinking about the other possibility, whether we should design it like this: in an intersection
Other;itís a simple solution but we could do it some way different like this but then we would probably need some kind of main, i donít know, main traffic light or reference point for the traffic lights so that we know, when will which one start and which one, so i mean
Other;or do we need this for every intersection?
Other;or down to up
Other;or one
Other;or other shorts what you defined with the circle, letís just say for the safe of complicity, itís like this, so then this one would be green in the beginning and by no car would be in this area, no car would be here, thatís, here we have these two nice cars
Other;or should you be able to set like, this is car spawn, the car spawn, which spawns cars and this is like a sync where cars disappear.
Other;perhaps we simplify draw intersections for lazy students
Other;so either they should be able to use go like 20 seconds red, blablabla blablabla or depending on this senso
Other;whether you should be able to position this car spawning symbol at the beginning or whether it should be just able to detect this is the beginning of the road
Other;yeah, of course we could also do it like this
Other;you have to switch to green or to orange or red
Other;is itpossible to break that down further
Other;a few tables
Other;and have uml diagram for the class structureof each object's attributes
Other;are all the opposing lanesalways the same state?
Other;arethere any critically used cases that you want to cover?
Other;description?
Other;did we have a constraint of only four roads per intersection?
Other;do we need a specific light object?
Other;do we want a reset?
Other;do we want to have it so that a car can make a turnand then change directions so that they're not always goingright?
Other;do we want to then annotate
Other;do wechange the light a lot here? do we flip the state of the lightsdifferently based on the state of the sensor
Other;do you want to keep it or do you want to do two queues.
Other;do you want to write ui stories?
Other;dowe want to have visualization of cars moving along aparticular road in a geometric sense?
Other;how do we create a network. so yeah, good maybe7node first so this is the intersections,
Other;how do you...?
Other;how you resize this thing. is thisthe actual window
Other;is itcapacity or average--capacity means like8
Other;is that also something the cop looksat?
Other;is there, put like connecting, is that
Other;is this all this sort of master control orwhatever? or should that go into where you push rulesdown to
Other;now can we do this
Other;now do we have three states for the light?
Other;one car or two
Other;should we define an initial simple intersection, an initialsimple car.
Other;the light will only staygreen for x amount of time?
Other;where's the first place to start?
Other;you've got two left-êturners. currently we've just gotgreen, red, and left. do we want to introduce the yellowwhere the last left-êturner
Other;are north and south the same?
Other;by default it either hasor doesn't have a left?hand turn, right?
Other;constant speed throughout?
Other;do youmeasure that something worked or didn't
Other;how do you visualize that?
Other;howdo you detect that
Other;like should we make itreally easy for them to set up a whole street's worth of trafficlights, so they're timed in sequence so that it's easy for trafficto flow through, or does that kind of defeat the purpose of theexercise for the students because
Other;o what would be an easy way to name each leg? so iguess it's likeó
Other;so we are assuming
Other;that's the thing, are the speeds to beassumed
Other;what does that mean
Other;you know
Other;you want to?
Other;does it run on a clock or does it run, you knowhow do you control this flow behavior?
Other;what does he tell the road object
Other;Ç-is this time for each one of these
Other;and is this lengthsignificant to store the number of cars
Other;and so do cars equaltraffic
Other;are we saying thoseare equal?
Other;areroads a significant thing here
Other;but do we really want to stopthe number of cars it keeps queuing up
Other;but then do you have to specifyoutput points?
Other;can we capture that
Other;do the roads delegate this, or do the intersections delegate all thecommunication
Other;do we care about you anymore?
Other;do we want to assume one lane of traffic coming in
Other;does it matter? direction?
Other;does thatoccur in the intersection? as a containing data entity? orconceptual entity?
Other;forthe yellow is consistent. or, is it consistent
Other;how do you definethe behavior of the traffic
Other;how do you do the traffic?
Other;how does thatwork?
Other;how does thisimpact what we need to model?
Other;i mean areroads saying, can i go? can i go? or are the intersectionsÇ-shouldthe intersection tell the road, you know, flow you know five cars.
Other;is itÇ-does it really stop?
Other;or do we care?
Other;orÇ-how does this look
Other;so how do you share that informationacross all the signals.
Other;so what are the aspects of the speed that are important?
Other;so what are the properties of traffic
Other;sodo we want to model that kind of multiÇ-thread of randombehavior? i think so
Other;thatÇ-is that more of the signals?
Other;the problem is how do youtell the intersection what road this connects to
Other;then it's an output?
Other;what are the properties of this?
Other;what does the sensor do
Other;what simplifying assumptions could we make initially and findthose
Other;whathappens in this model?
Other;which ones do we want to have
Other;is there a speed limit of the road or the actual velocity of the car going through the road because that might not be the same
Other;is there something in addition we want to have
Other;and how are those most easily calculated?
Other;did i misinterpret that
Other;how do we want the relations to be?
Other;in the middle?
Other;itís okay if i add density to the traffic?
Other;one traffic light should have a single intersection, right?
Other;or is there something specific which we would like to have on endpoints
Other;road endpoint, maybe?
Other;shoud i call it single traffic, road traffic , specific traffic,
Other;should it be on a bigger level?
Other;should it be on a kind of big level or is it sufficient to just have a number of intersections with roads connecting them in terms of class relationships i mean.
Other;should we do a drawing for that
Other;would that not be a property of the intersection?
Other;is there a speed limit of the road or the actual velocity of the car going through the road because that might not be the same
Other;is there something in addition we want to have
Other;and how are those most easily calculated?
Other;did i misinterpret that
Other;how do we want the relations to be?
Other;in the middle?
Other;itís okay if i add density to the traffic?
Other;one traffic light should have a single intersection, right?
Other;but the question is where we put something to zoom in and out. perhaps in the same way it is done in the whiteboard softwa
Other;do we assume that the cars always drive straight ahead or maybe, because otherwise we would need to differentiate between roads that turn to the right, roads that turn to the left, just ahead
Other;ow to control the flow.
Other;so, ok, what kind of options should we have?
Other;what would be the best procedure to start with.
Other;but it's not necessarily realistic
Other;but the light would then have to
Other;but then there's
Other;but you know
Other;, but whatabout the--how
Other;and have uml diagram for the class structureof each object's attributes
Other;but
Other;but also it'sanalytic data saying okay you're still in this queue
Other;but beginning when youjust
Other;but i imagine the controller controls that, right, the modelbasically is just the basically cars, the queue of cars, theintersection contains four queues.
Other;but i think that would become a bit spaghetti
Other;but if you
Other;but let's leave observe
Other;but not necessarilyall red.
Other;but only if
Other;but roads
Other;but that, but this simulation
Other;but the push is really
Other;but then let's
Other;but then there's horizontal-êleft,vertical-êleft.
Other;but then we can
Other;but we've
Other;but what
Other;butthen
Other;butwhat's--i'd imagine
Other;we've kind of done it here, butit's kind of messy
Other;but how
Other;but at the same
Other;but given what we have we think you can start ona prototype.
Other;but ideally you'd want to have an ability for thesystem to self?adjust so that would be like the second stagewhere you go and figure
Other;but it's not
Other;but then again
Other;but there's not a lot of, you
Other;buti
Other;butthat
Other;n red for the remainder, andthen
Other;but also at eachintersection you can say this percentage is going to do this forvarying reasons that we don't
Other;i see the big picture, but i don't know the intersections
Other;but at
Other;but do we really want to stopthe number of cars it keeps queuing up
Other;but i'm
Other;but lengthis
Other;but then do you have to specifyoutput points?
Other;but then this
Other;but we may need to trackÇ-we may need toset up outputs you know
Other;but what would the outputs necessarily be of that
Other;but, i think
Other;butthen there's
Other;butthis can be dictated
Other;it's just a green but
Other;but i mean having a selection is probably makes it
Other;but is that?
Other;i thought it would be different, but i guess this would also be fine
Other;itís not stated there, but we think it would be useful
Other;but also for calculating statistics
Other;but first maybe we can discuss how to, whatís the best way to define the problem in itself
Other;but i assume roads will also be a form of association
Other;but i would assume
Other;but if you say map is our starting point and everything is connected to this by association or something like that would be fine for me.
Other;but itís just the surrounding
Other;but maybe first
Other;but the overall implementation should be able to work with more roads or less.
Other;but then again how would you declare
Other;but we want to say if we make a throughput through the system via endpoints we would have traffic on endpoints
Other;but why do i want to move the intersection?
Other;but why donít we have a traffic model per se?
Other;but would traffic class in that case, does it make sense to have the relation to the road itself
Other;do we really have an actual intersection as an item or is it just indirectly given if you do an intersection?
Other;i asked if that is what you wanted, but it sounds like it was not
Other;i donít know how to call it but we can also use it to influence the traffic from outside, which could be something specific
Other;itís not specifically defined but the purpose
Other;maybe i miss something right now but these are for my feelings the things we could represent in the class model.
Other;of course we can represent this here but we should also keep in mind that this could be changed in the future and that we should design the system that is able to change this.
Other;but itís just the surrounding
Other;but maybe first
Other;but the overall implementation should be able to work with more roads or less.

Other;of course we can represent this here but we should also keep in mind that this could be changed in the future and that we should design the system that is able to change this.
Other;but of course also
Other;anyway, but that the
Other;but i donít think it is necessary, but i mean that depends
Other;but i mean a very easy way, oh but then you have to rename them
Other;but i think it might not be very handsome for meaning for the
Other;but if
Other;but rather focus
Other;but that they reference each other in some way.
Other;but then
Other;but then i mean
Other;but then i was thinking about how to describe the sequence and
Other;but we probably also need to take some delay into account
Other;i donít know
Other;it's basically, yeah, i mean you can think of, it's aperson
Other;it's like okay i'vebeen in this state
Other;got it. alright
Other;i like that.
Other;it's the god alright, it's the master controller
Other;oh, that's right, the speed of simulation
Other;right, yeah
Other;that's true, that's true. okay
Other;well that's a good point, though,
Other;well, let's establish the rules
Other;yeah that sounds more realistic.
Other;yeah. i like that.
Other;and it's a very kind of recursive problem
Other;definitely
Other;i wouldn't want
Other;if i move this, how does it change this
Other;it's nice in the simulation to be able to watch what'sgoing on here
Other;oh right, so they could be different
Other;on this map.
Other;that would be very awkward
Other;that's true
Other;that's what i was going to say, yeah
Other;that's what i was saying
Other;yeah that makes sense
Other;, that makes a lot of sense
Other;a queue with a limit
Other;because you're right
Other;exactly
Other;exactly, exactly.
Other;exactly, yeah exactly.
Other;interesting question
Other;it does, yeah
Other;makes sense.
Other;right
Other;sure, yeah, yeah.
Other;that fit, so
Other;that fit.
Other;that makes sense
Other;that's interesting
Other;that's the perfect simplification.
Other;that's what i'm trying to figure out.
Other;yeah, exactly.
Other;should make it much easier, youíre right
Other;alright, yes, sure
Other;fair enough.
Other;i think itís a good idea
Other;same thing here
Other;so i usually start with a data model, so a class diagram is probably a good idea
Conversation Management;sure.
Conversation Management;thatís fine
Conversation Management;we need to do one of the representations meaning thatÖ i mean you are right on the loose ends, i Creative Conflict on that
Conversation Management;yes thatís fine.
Conversation Management;yes, for sure
Conversation Management;you are right
Conversation Management;should make it much easier, youíre right
Conversation Management;alright, yes, sure
Conversation Management;fair enough.
Conversation Management;i think itís a good idea
Conversation Management;same thing here
Conversation Management;so i usually start with a data model, so a class diagram is probably a good idea
Other;the cop is looking at well state of thesignal and the some
Other;crossing roads
Other;i meant connecting intersections
Other;inaudible] has a type for a
Other;it's sayinghow far along are you in your road
Other;oh right, like a traffic jam
Other;one car per tic.
Other;so our onramp, offramp
Other;speed of simulation
Other;start, observe, and then we'll put pause
Other;the next direction of the car.
Other;traverser of network
Other;two queues.
Other;in other words
Other;in other words it would seem to me that ideally you'dwant to draw this out of the box with all defaults and somedefault settings based on some package
Other;in other words,
Other;so if we did 2 minutes, that's 120 seconds. so the entireduration is 120 seconds
Other;so there's lik
Other;so, like yousaid, if you click on here and double click on here then there'ssome form that lets you collect the information about thatintersection.
Other;imean they can't make a left
Other;kind of a twice [inaudible
Other;the traffic wants to know.
Other;there's a time for each of those. tÇ-r, tÇ-yellow, tÇ-green
Other;howcongested is it?
Other;is itpossible to break that down further
Other;a few tables
Other;and have uml diagram for the class structureof each object's attributes
Other;and ithas a queue, which of course has push [inaudible]. okay.
Other;and that would be what?
Other;are all the opposing lanesalways the same state?
Other;are they controlling
Other;arethere any critically used cases that you want to cover?
Other;description?
Other;did we have a constraint of only four roads per intersection?
Other;do we need a specific light object?
Other;do we want a reset?
Other;do we want to have it so that a car can make a turnand then change directions so that they're not always goingright?
Other;do we want to then annotate
Other;do wechange the light a lot here? do we flip the state of the lightsdifferently based on the state of the sensor
Other;do you want to keep it or do you want to do two queues.
Other;do you want to write ui stories?
Other;does that saygreen, red, and left?
Other;does the network also split up the roads
Other;dowe want to have visualization of cars moving along aparticular road in a geometric sense?
Other;how do icreate an intersection
Other;how do we create a network. so yeah, good maybe7node first so this is the intersections,
Other;how do you...?
Other;how you resize this thing. is thisthe actual window
Other;is itcapacity or average--capacity means like8
Other;is itthe same thing?
Other;is that also something the cop looksat?
Other;is there, put like connecting, is that
Other;is this all this sort of master control orwhatever? or should that go into where you push rulesdown to
Other;it has sensors and, it has the timing, current state, no it hasticks in current state
Other;now can we do this
Other;now do we have three states for the light?
Other;one car or two
Other;should we define an initial simple intersection, an initialsimple car.
Other;so they can build on?
Other;so what basic data structures are we looking at here?
Other;something?
Other;the light will only staygreen for x amount of time?
Other;what elsedo we have
Other;what would this guy have?
Other;where does that say off ramp?
Other;where's the first place to start?
Other;would that be a property of the queue or a property of thecar?
Other;you mean the actual data structures?
Other;you've got two left-êturners. currently we've just gotgreen, red, and left. do we want to introduce the yellowwhere the last left-êturner
Other;, this would be visible
Other;and what does that mean?
Other;and where do you see
Other;are north and south the same?
Other;are there other objects?
Other;because
Other;because you would have to moveseveral blocks at the same time.
Other;but does it have only lefthand?
Other;but what constitutes a well?movingtraffic
Other;but what does the intersection, what is the purpose of theintersection in life
Other;by default it either hasor doesn't have a left?hand turn, right?
Other;constant speed throughout?
Other;distances, and density relate to it?
Other;do youmeasure that something worked or didn't
Other;he second?
Other;how do you know who's waiting and why
Other;how do you visualize that?
Other;howdo you detect that
Other;i mean how do you visualize this simulation
Other;like should we make itreally easy for them to set up a whole street's worth of trafficlights, so they're timed in sequence so that it's easy for trafficto flow through, or does that kind of defeat the purpose of theexercise for the students because
Other;o what would be an easy way to name each leg? so iguess it's likeó
Other;right
Other;so we are assuming
Other;that green is on?
Other;that's the thing, are the speeds to beassumed
Other;then, what was the information wehad
Other;what are the goals, and how are they set
Other;what does that mean
Other;what does that mean?
Other;what else are we going to be drawing?
Other;where was the part where there was something about waittime
Other;you know
Other;you want to?
Other;does it run on a clock or does it run, you knowhow do you control this flow behavior?
Other;what does he tell the road object
Other;Ç-is this time for each one of these
Other;and is this lengthsignificant to store the number of cars
Other;and so do cars equaltraffic
Other;are we saying thoseare equal?
Other;areroads a significant thing here
Other;but do we really want to stopthe number of cars it keeps queuing up
Other;but then do you have to specifyoutput points?
Other;can we capture that
Other;do the roads delegate this, or do the intersections delegate all thecommunication
Other;do we care about you anymore?
Other;do we want to assume one lane of traffic coming in
Other;does it matter? direction?
Other;does it say anything about the number of lanes?
Other;does thatoccur in the intersection? as a containing data entity? orconceptual entity?
Other;forthe yellow is consistent. or, is it consistent
Other;how do we?
Other;how do you coordinate that between all signals at eachintersection?
Other;how do you definethe behavior of the traffic
Other;how do you do the traffic?
Other;how does thatwork?
Other;how does thisimpact what we need to model?
Other;i mean areroads saying, can i go? can i go? or are the intersectionsÇ-shouldthe intersection tell the road, you know, flow you know five cars.
Other;is it a push or a pull model with the intersections
Other;is itÇ-does it really stop?
Other;is there a leftÇ-turn lane, or is it a suicide left?
Other;or do we care?
Other;orÇ-how does this look
Other;so how do you share that informationacross all the signals.
Other;so howÇ-what is the behavior of the inputs andwould there be any requirements on that?
Other;so in total?
Other;so nowcome back up, what big concepts haven't we captured yet
Other;so what are the aspects of the speed that are important?
Other;so what are the properties of traffic
Other;sodo we want to model that kind of multiÇ-thread of randombehavior? i think so
Other;thatÇ-is that more of the signals?
Other;that's where i always liketo start. how do you see the code beingÇ-just kind of thestructure of it being broken down?
Other;the only thing i'm kind of botheredis how do weÇ-how does this guy come into play in all of this?
Other;the problem is how do youtell the intersection what road this connects to
Other;the sensors?
Other;then it's an output?
Other;what about it?
Other;what are the properties of this?
Other;what are we seeing here
Other;what does the sensor do
Other;what simplifying assumptions could we make initially and findthose
Other;whathappens in this model?
Other;whatproperties of roads we have to worry about
Other;which ones do we want to have
Other;would it add a car?
Other;do we have something in vision
Other;do you have a better statement?
Other;is there a speed limit of the road or the actual velocity of the car going through the road because that might not be the same
Other;is there something in addition we want to have
Other;ah road density or traffic density?
Other;and how are those most easily calculated?
Other;are you writing anything right now?
Other;by moving the intersection you mean also changing the geometrical appearance of the roads?
Other;did i misinterpret that
Other;do we really have an actual intersection as an item or is it just indirectly given if you do an intersection?
Other;do you have other points regarding what you can design on the map?
Other;do you have something else?
Other;do you just want to be able to design the traffic for one of the parts?
Other;do you want to only be able to design the overall thing, which then would be an issue regarding the traffic
Other;how do we continue based on that?
Other;how do we want the relations to be?
Other;how do you know where one road starts and where one ends?
Other;i mean what are the types of metrics that we want to have in percent?
Other;in the middle?
Other;is a road always that ending at an intersection or is a road like the designer when he starts to design the map, like i did right now?
Other;is it currently disturbing
Other;is it mentioned in the task or do you just think it would be useful?
Other;is it the traffic of the whole system or the traffic of a single road
Other;is this something which is defined in the task or do you think itís just optional we could add it?
Other;itís okay if i add density to the traffic?
Other;okay, so visual map would be houses and the cars travelling on the road and so on?
Other;one traffic light should have a single intersection, right?
Other;or is there something specific which we would like to have on endpoints
Other;road endpoint, maybe?
Other;shoud i call it single traffic, road traffic , specific traffic,
Other;should it be on a bigger level?
Other;should it be on a kind of big level or is it sufficient to just have a number of intersections with roads connecting them in terms of class relationships i mean.
Other;should we do a drawing for that
Other;so what was the question?
Other;so whatís the difference between the visual map and the rad layout
Other;so you just mean the attributes regarding sensor and the assigned traffic lights and traffic behavior?
Other;the only thing that is actually set is the density per road what would that view contain?
Other;the question is what do you want to do as a designer?
Other;the question is what is a road?
Other;what do you mean bigger level?
Other;what do you mean by moving the intersection?
Other;what do you want to say?
Other;what is it?
Other;what is the traffic class actually representing
Other;what more do we have as part of the intersection?
Other;what was it
Other;what was it?
Other;what was your point?
Other;what were you thinking?
Other;where did you write?
Other;why what? the part i donít get is why we donít have traffic density.
Other;would that not be a property of the intersection?
Other;yes, i mean my main point is what would be part of that view?
Other;yes, so anything else?
Other;you asked if we have another attribute for intersection?
Other;you mean attributes describing the geometrical positioning of everything?
Other;you mean each traffic light?
Conversation Management;what was it?
Conversation Management;what was your point?
Conversation Management;what were you thinking?
Conversation Management;where did you write?
Conversation Management;why what? the part i donít get is why we donít have traffic density.
Conversation Management;would that not be a property of the intersection?
Conversation Management;yes, i mean my main point is what would be part of that view?
Conversation Management;yes, so anything else?
Conversation Management;you asked if we have another attribute for intersection?
Conversation Management;you mean attributes describing the geometrical positioning of everything?
Conversation Management;you mean each traffic light?
Conversation Management;but the question is where we put something to zoom in and out. perhaps in the same way it is done in the whiteboard softwa
Conversation Management;do they have to?
Conversation Management;do we assume that the cars always drive straight ahead or maybe, because otherwise we would need to differentiate between roads that turn to the right, roads that turn to the left, just ahead
Conversation Management;do we have to do something
Conversation Management;in the four?
Conversation Management;is there a certain reason for you drawing this options of like roads or traffic signs to the right hand side of the window?
Conversation Management;is this how they set, did you mean, by adding car symbols?
Conversation Management;ow to control the flow.
Conversation Management;so, ok, what kind of options should we have?
Conversation Management;what do you mean?
Conversation Management;what would be the best procedure to start with.
Conversation Management;which other one
Conversation Management;yeah, which one starts, yeah exactly, which one is triggered first, thatís what you mean?
Conversation Management;yeah, you mean that we somehow connect them?
Conversation Management;you mean the signals of the same intersection
Conversation Management;you wouldnít provide some kind of element to draw intersections immediately but rather focus on drawing streets and then for like crossing streets we then have intersections that should be detected automatically?
Conversation Management;do we care?
Conversation Management;really
Conversation Management;but we have the roads.
Conversation Management;huh? road traffic?
Conversation Management;really?
Conversation Management;sorry
Conversation Management;sorry?
Conversation Management;what am i doing wrong?
Conversation Management;7right?
Conversation Management;a queue of cars.
Conversation Management;a specific car?
Conversation Management;does that seem reasonable?
Conversation Management;goes from blue to orange right?
Conversation Management;intersection?
Conversation Management;is that true?3well
Conversation Management;is that what your saying
Conversation Management;okay?
Conversation Management;once again, it's per tick right
Conversation Management;one car per tick
Conversation Management;onramp right?
Conversation Management;pretty simple guy though right
Conversation Management;right
Conversation Management;right.
Conversation Management;right?
Conversation Management;toanalytics right?
Conversation Management;yeah,
Conversation Management;and this is a real?time table?
Conversation Management;are you saying there's actually a car out there
Conversation Management;but not every car that starts at c would do that?
Conversation Management;did it saythat?
Conversation Management;how do you report the final results?
Conversation Management;so it has four approaches at most?
Conversation Management;so you want to leave one of these constant and change theother.
Conversation Management;this is cars?
Conversation Management;you can buildmultiple simulations on this map
Conversation Management;you know?
Conversation Management;you say, i want 50 cars like this.
Conversation Management;you think?
Conversation Management;do we really want that
Conversation Management;is it safe from stuff like that
Conversation Management;is that really the only thing?
Conversation Management;kind of?
Conversation Management;so can you hit all the green
Conversation Management;this is on the road isn't it
Conversation Management;well?
Conversation Management;does that fit to you view as well?
Conversation Management;a sketch for the interface?
Conversation Management;did you remove it?
Conversation Management;do you understand my point?
Conversation Management;have you seen what iím drawing on my side?
Conversation Management;how much time is left? 10.30?
Conversation Management;is it okay in that state?
Conversation Management;is it okay?
Conversation Management;is my handwriting okay?
Conversation Management;is that big enough?
Conversation Management;is that okay?
Conversation Management;remove everything
Conversation Management;right? is that correct?
Conversation Management;should i start?
Conversation Management;that will be the timing scheme?
Conversation Management;which is if we go to the visual item and have the map is okay, isnít it?
Conversation Management;why we move the intersection you mean?
Conversation Management;would that be okay?
Conversation Management;you can read it?
Conversation Management;you mean each traffic light?
Conversation Management;you see my line?
Conversation Management;you can read it?
Conversation Management;you mean each traffic light?
Conversation Management;you see my line?
Conversation Management;alright?
Conversation Management;because orange is both, preparing to start, well how does it work, and then it is also hinting that soon it will be red, right?
Conversation Management;but do you mean like this?
Conversation Management;but they will always be the same, right?
Conversation Management;can you remember, did the task description say something concerning this
Conversation Management;did you hear rodi?
Conversation Management;did you turn of the screen recording?
Conversation Management;do you get what i mean?
Conversation Management;i was thinking if we should have triggers as you said i mean of the signals.
Conversation Management;is it right?
Conversation Management;ok?
Conversation Management;or what do you think?
Conversation Management;right
Conversation Management;right?
Conversation Management;shall i give it a try?
Conversation Management;should be able to set that one?
Conversation Management;so we keep that?
Conversation Management;so you mean if the user uses the intersection symbol, then it would automatically create the traffic light in a specific way.
Conversation Management;ulation, i mean, letís just assume that, to safe some complicity that we will start with, that we only have this simple intersection and we start the simulation and this car makes this and there is no car, it would actually start with a green fix at this traffic light, right?
Conversation Management;with the sensors or?
Conversation Management;with this slidebar at the bottom, or so something like this
Conversation Management;you know what i mean?
Conversation Management;you mean that user doesnít have to draw it anyway, but that the software would detect it and then say ok, you draw an intersection, i will add traffic lights on my own
Conversation Management;assess the load on an9intersection
Conversation Management;get a little more sophisticated.
Conversation Management;i guess the other thing that would be--the other big piecehere is analytics,
Conversation Management;let's go back to the model6for a second
Conversation Management;maybe we can peg that for the moment and introducethat as we flush this out
Conversation Management;maybe we can use this space.
Conversation Management;okay this is getting morecomplicated
Other;is it the traffic of the whole system or the traffic of a single road
Other;is there a speed limit of the road or the actual velocity of the car going through the road because that might not be the same.
Other;it should also have traffic lights as an association i guess
Other;it should be four, or actually it should be two.
Other;itís better that we make an overall abstract statement in the time
Other;later on we could also have this for the purposes you have described that all the attributes of the car like length or speed could influence the traffic at all.
Other;maybe i would actually draw traffic as a completely separate entity
Other;okay, so i put the velocity here.
Other;one of these is always connected to the road which would be enough.
Other;one traffic light should have a single intersection, right?
Other;road was for me another class.
Other;so here it is an intersection with traffic lights, which are from our understanding four, but letís say in general it could be a star
Other;so i would add a visual item
Other;so it could also be that intersection is just an subclass of endpoint
Other;so this is just internals, maybe we need something more in terms of the visualization.
Other;the relation between traffic and road like a star, you could have this traffic item in the kind of library and just make it drag and drop to specific roads or endpoints that you can reuse the definition
Other;the system is working, then additional things will be requested and itís better to have it already separated instead of putting all in one class
Other;the timing behavior would be something related to traffic lights.
Other;then we have four of those
Other;then we have the model, we have the view, but we donít have the controller
Other;traffic here, traffic lights and then we add the timing behavior
Other;we are going for a more model-view-controller pattern or something like that maybe we want to separate the visualization
Other;we donít need a traffic class.
Other;we have a map, some formal map, we have some formal representation of an intersection.
Other;what is the traffic class actually representing
Other;yes i would keep the traffic class also for reuse purposes
Other;you could also do something like, letís say we have a traffic and this would have the cars with whatever attributes.
Other;i guess i should put wait time here, capacity here.
Other;also maybe analyze the load on an intersection for road, fora particular road
Other;and so, should we say the initial state would be this lightsgreen and this lights green.
Other;and that also maybe also [inaudible] as the right hand turn
Other;and then depending on 3what type of car, you queue it up on the lane.
Other;because i think observegets into the analytics
Other;but i think that would become a bit spaghetti
Other;cuz that's something
Other;here, maybe we should do it a little moreformally
Other;i guess aspects of parameters of the simulation, really
Other;i guess in our view that's not always true
Other;i guess the only last thing isthere are cars that are created by the--cars that are createdessentially by the cop and introduced into onramp roads.and they have certain states, we've said.
Other;i guess the other thing that would be--the other big piecehere is analytics,
Other;i think we canassume we have a video camera rolling and we can gothrough the other scenarios
Other;i'm thinking that would be implicit inthe sense that i drag a road vertical, and i drag a roadhorizontal and the geometric--
Other;i'm wondering with half an hour left if we need to thinkabout how to--
Other;it might not even matter so much in that
Other;it's almost like you need to traffic cop, right, traffic copcontroller
Other;it's like there's a network kind of as well saying, okaywell we--i have, this line here says for each road in thesimulation do something.
Other;maybe this is this card, this push notion right now and just ahand wave and have it happening in a global sense
Other;maybe we randomize the--at a pop and push. wealso then randomize the actual direction of the car.
Other;now left-êturn is a little more special
Other;one thing we could simplify is, in order to get--because thismatters
Other;say start with a model and start with the simplestmodel to get the simplest intersection flowing with cars andtiming
Other;so i guess then [inaudible] is no pop
Other;so maybe we should run through some,you know, how pictures will change from one moment oftime to another and think about how the software wouldcreate those pictures maybe.
Other;so what i'm thinking is maybe there's arandom number generator here that has two inputs of likebasically the probability, right
Other;so, let's say delta one tic maybe or something
Other;speed of the car
Other;the cop, let's do--so it has sort of rules
Other;there's rules governing if you have two carsgoing into the same road, which goes first per tick,
Other;those are randomly generated, and maybe thetype of car has a random output
Other;we could make this pretty simple
Other;whether it has a sensor, and maybe some logic around--sortof setting in the rules we need some sort of rule editor
Other;would that be a property of the car onthe current wait time or something like that
Other;yeah maybe let's start with thenetwork
Other;yeah we could make it all horizontal and vertical roads soyou start on, off, on, off, intersection,
Other;we'll say you should getstarted on this much, we need to go and clarify this withprofessor e
Other;and also
Other;and it also seems like
Other;and then we have some way of saying
Other;but also i think
Other;deally, thesystem should be able to
Other;either
Other;erhaps theres
Other;i could see in subsequent versions
Other;i feel likeyou should have to specify only maybe two directions orsomething
Other;i guess
Other;i guess that's all.
Other;i just think
Other;i like it better down there
Other;i mean we couldjust say, you know, the distance between 1st street and 2ndstreet is this,
Other;i think
Other;i think from the user's perspective
Other;i think that's an importantpart of it
Other;i think the intersections just occur.
Other;i think this
Other;i think we kind of covered all thethings we wrote up here
Other;i would go
Other;i would probably wantto be able to hover and somehow in?place edit
Other;i would say
Other;i'll tell you what's going to be interesting is these students,whether there's civil engineers but, you know they're doingcomputer science stuff, so their next step after this is to takethe software that you've been given and program the smartsinto it so that it can do the timing for you automatically.
Other;i'm entertaining this idea
Other;i'm still unhappy
Other;i'mguessing
Other;it almost seems like
Other;it also seems
Other;it does seemlike
Other;it might
Other;it might be
Other;it seems like here,
Other;ithink
Other;maybe
Other;maybe even you could
Other;maybe just click here
Other;maybe the way to approach
Other;maybe theres also
Other;maybe this is just a learning tool
Other;next release we'll let them add theirown fancy street names
Other;o i would take the map drawingas one thing
Other;okay so then we have a map
Other;right now i would just leave it
Other;so i think
Other;so it could be
Other;so why don't we start out
Other;t does seem like it would begood
Other;then i think
Other;there might be
Other;there was something about reducing wait?time and
Other;think
Other;think that
Other;this has to be like the main objec
Other;we build a flex application
Other;we could have
Other;we haven't really,this is where we find some conflict
Other;you know, in some ways it seems
Other;you know, we should think about that
Other;you need some control with the flow
Other;you'd set a rate
Other;i think, kind of the we would have to use[inaudible
Other;i thinkwe just go off the number of signals at each intersection.
Other;think one thing is that the controls have to modify the signaltimings and the sensors so we basically got to just basically sayhere's
Other;think that at that point,we don't really care.
Other;think there's another thing you captured here. there'sthese inputs. and the road can actually have or, you know.
Other;think we can make that first clean division
Other;think, is the model on which to build the end userapplication.
Other;i guess that dependency is really comes back to the signals
Other;i guess the issues that are going to come into play are
Other;i think it's a simplification
Other;i think it's just more consistent
Other;i think it's more of a collection of signals because
Other;i think its more of the number of cars in period of time
Other;i think really we care more about
Other;i think that these are the only ones that should be toggable
Other;i think the road's going to have to be a little bit smarter
Other;i think theintersection's going toÇ-basically its interface is looking at that,its going to say road give me left cars, give me straight cars, giveme right cars
Other;i think there's aÇ-should be [inaudible] this if not just two fulllanes
Other;i think they're pretty straightÇ-forwardobjects
Other;i think those were the main big players
Other;i think we have
Other;i'm saying this is probably the best assumption
Other;it seems like a, for this type of problem a good first attack is justkind of a, you know a data analysis
Other;so i think one of the things we'recoming out is the roadÇ-i don't know if it has lanes so much as ithas, you know left, straight, right.
Other;so let's go with the minimum so
Other;so maybe the data structure is set up where we don'tcare, i don't think we do care
Other;we can say iÇ-
Other;we might have to say add left caradd straight car, there might be more to the road i'm starting tothink.
Other;yeah i'm justÇ-do a flat file, sterilize it all
Other;you know, the leftcan go at the same time and then.
Other;i guess there needs to be a timer for
Other;i think itís useful,
Other;i think the sensors are on the road rather connecting the intersections rather than on the intersection
Other;it could be that this is roads specific
Other;i guess the map can stay there
Other;i guess there should be some statistics in terms of like the total throughput of the system or something like that. runtime statistics
Other;i guess timing behavior would be something in relation to traffic lights
Other;i mean the combination of possible roads would become a combinatorial exploration
Other;i mean the naÔve way to go about it would just start with a map and then assume that everything is a subset of a map.
Other;i mean they should contain information like density and optionally it may have speed limits and so on.
Other;i would say we have a visual item and that could be either road or traffic light or car
Other;it would be road property i think
Other;maybe we can also move it. maybe itís possible, i can try
Other;maybe we just keep this in mind and then itís fine
Other;maybe we should clarify that and say that there should be one traffic light at each entry point into the intersection
Other;maybe we should clarify that each entry point into the intersection
Other;maybe you want to calculate exactly how long it takes for a single car to go from one end to the other end of the map or something like that
Other;should we also include the velocity, the speed limits of the cars
Other;to the roads, not the intersections
Other;we could do such a thing
Other;we could have some kind of input traffic, but the traffic is already designed per road
Other;yes maybe road traffic
Other;yes, how much in detail thatís something we can discuss
Other;am trying to remember how thatís in real traffic
Other;at the start of the road you can create new cars or define the number of cars, whether they want to, changing it during the simulation
Other;but i think we need for, do we need this for one intersection
Other;but that, yeah, i mean, thatís the thing, they will always work in pairs, it doesnít matter if it is 3 or 1, that have a car, just that itís, i mean north and south, or up and down
Other;erhaps we have somewhat, five seconds orange, 30 seconds green
Other;i am thinking maybe we should have that in,
Other;i donít know, 10 cars per minute, or whatever way you want to define it then itís actually in this, in this certain interval it just produces new cars and shows new cars crossing the traffic lights, something like this
Other;i guess a common, atleast here in sweden is that the main road is always green if it doesnít detect anything coming from the crossing roads so the big road is always green but when thereís cars coming in from left or right it detects that and then it sets the main road to red so that they can join
Other;i guess we should have a play button for the simulation and when you hit that one, it starts with the one that is marked
Other;i mean it would be more fun to have turning
Other;i mean so every start of a road that has just starting is, i guess an entry point then and then you can set it on these, so here
Other;i think i would actually, like something like this that you can put some points on this and i donít know, a car spawner or whatever and say click on it and the you say another one, another one, another one so that the user can basically decide, where to put it and create as many cars as he likes to
Other;i think perhaps we can
Other;i think the more interesting and the more challenging part is behavior of the traffic lights
Other;i would like this to be an intersection automatically
Conversation Management;maybe itís enough to set those
Conversation Management;maybe we have a delay where nothing happens and then it just goes through the flow here and when that one is done it jumps to the up and down again, because as you said, up and down and left and right will be the same, right?
Conversation Management;mean depending on how it works, yeah, exactly, so do we have to prevent them to be both, they shouldnít be green at the same time, thatís an obvious one, but could they be orange at the same time but in different phases, one before it turns red and one before it turns green.
Conversation Management;mean the traffic lights look good now, i think
Conversation Management;mean, this one turning red, that one that we were talking about, could trigger the flow in this one
Conversation Management;o maybe it should be, only enters at end of roads somewhere
Conversation Management;ok itís a bad idea to arrange it according to the direction of the lane
Conversation Management;or should we just say here, here you just spawn cars, oh no, another way, here and here and here and here
Conversation Management;so i am thinking, how to represent the sequence because if you have it like that you can have like a box here or somewhere else which says, ok, this sequence is triggered by signal two becoming green.
Conversation Management;so i think perhaps we can just focus on the traffic light and the description of the behavior before we draw anything again
Conversation Management;so i think, whatís possible, correct me if you disCreative Conflict, it might be possible that there is no car on lane 1 and there are cars on lane 3, so just because no cars one lane 1 does mean that you can turn traffic light 2 to green, because if a car is at 3 then there might be an accident by this.
Conversation Management;so in this case it is like in 1 has no, 1 no car and three no car, so you can turn 2 and 4, i donít know, something like this.
Conversation Management;so once again before we can probably, or how is it done? we need to consider those, both traffic lights again so, so this one and this one, another simplified version
Conversation Management;so we do not need to, the user doesnít need to draw a new kind of symbol as similar to the net but itís
Conversation Management;so yo click on it and then you set that
Conversation Management;so, yeah, some way of indicating where it will start
Conversation Management;t they could just cross the traffic lights and also next to them
Conversation Management;that you define it in the user interface if you if you describe the behavior, perhaps like, i donít know. i mean it may just probably not, perhaps not a main for reference
Conversation Management;then letís say that maybe there is a delay before the other starts it sequence being orange and then
Conversation Management;then our system would need to detect this and put, i guess, switch this to, i donít know, orange or, i think itís a problem that you could draw, this problems my draw, something was wrong before, so we would probably need to change this to red light and then this to orange or green and this switching right.
Conversation Management;then you can say that ok this sequence is triggered by this signal turning green for example so when this other turns green then the sequence will go and then you can have
Conversation Management;we could actually draw some kind of car symbol there
Conversation Management;we just have to, like one traffic light at the beginning, something like this. so then we know for sure that the first car can drive up here, so some other car can also for 35 seconds at least.
Conversation Management;we say 45 and then i donít know, maybe we set orange afterwards as well, so this is that one that this, that one we talked about first, the one going down and up, when that one is red, this flow triggers, so it just goes back and forth and then maybe as you said
Conversation Management;yeah, main or start or whatever
Conversation Management;yes, a minimap
Conversation Management;you should be able to say how many cars per or something it should create
Conversation Management;i want to basically i want to controlaspects of the intersection
Conversation Management;probably need to talk to professor e alittle more about that.
Conversation Management;put it up there.
Conversation Management;want to draw something?
Conversation Management;what i would do is
Conversation Management;do you want to do it or should i continue?
Conversation Management;do you want to model as use case?
Conversation Management;i start with a map?
Conversation Management;maybe just call it tool box or something like that
Conversation Management;should we do a drawing for that or
Conversation Management;should we draw it in detail or do we just make a statement on what we have, what needs to be visualized, the roads, the traffic lights and the cars
Conversation Management;then i remove the drawings of the roads?
Conversation Management;we could do just a mock up if you like
Conversation Management;you want me to try? okay
Conversation Management;no, no go ahead.
Conversation Management;perhaps you can do the intersections
Conversation Management;was thinking, up to this point we'vesaid intersections contain the roads
Conversation Management;, it saysstudents must be able to describe the behavior of trafficlights on each of the intersection so that's maybe building uifor this intersection piece where we allow the user to set atime, or set a--
Conversation Management;2c says students should be able to design eachintersection with or without the option of sensors
Conversation Management;a couple more advanced details is there's the left-êhand turn
Conversation Management;by now we select the intersection, you couldgo to the analytics now. there's a coloring of theintersection as it grows and then the specifics of theanalytics
Conversation Management;it does say...here, every intersection on the map must havetraffic signals, all intersections will be four way. there are not-êintersections. nor one-êway roads.
Conversation Management;i've got some ideas around intersections androads
Conversation Management;okay so students should be ableto choose... students should be able to observe any progress4with their map's timing scheme--okay so that comes back toanalytics
Conversation Management;random number generator is controlling push. andthat happens for every tick.
Conversation Management;so it says here students should be able to choose the trafficdensity they're interested in on a given road
Conversation Management;so this is kind of like our cop rules, right
Conversation Management;so tick happens and changes time, cop is watchingtime
Conversation Management;start, pause, reset. then maybe thenext one will be added on to observe
Conversation Management;that's what we'rekind of doing here
Conversation Management;we have some constraints on the flow of
Conversation Management;we have the notion ofqueuing and de-êqueuing
Conversation Management;we need to design the basic structure of the code thatwill be used to implement the system.
Conversation Management;we now have two 1types of car. straight-êthrough guy and left-êturn, right turn,left-êturn.
Conversation Management;well it does say that something that the user couldcontrol
Conversation Management;well it says the student must be able to simulate traffic flowson the map. students should be able to change the trafficdensity that enters the map on a given road.
Conversation Management;what we have in our model so far is intersectionthat has the light
Conversation Management;and it says there is some package that has some understandingof how speeds
Conversation Management;basically we have three differentóthere's editing themap, building the map is one mode. and then there's buildingthe simulation betweenóand we could use the map too
Conversation Management;but we don't have enoughinformation here. there might be packages out there
Conversation Management;didn't get to the sensors at all
Conversation Management;have up to six intersections.
Conversation Management;i told you the streets, intersections,left and right, i told you traffic patterns, you figure out what thelights are.
Conversation Management;it said we can figure that out.
Conversation Management;oh okay, in the idealcase, the amount of time people spend waiting is minimized bythe chosen settings for the given intersection's traffic lights.
Conversation Management;okay we've assigned speeds,we've moved the roads, we draw the roads, inspectintersections and lights, okay
Conversation Management;okay, create visual map, clean up roads and pattern ofchoosing...
Conversation Management;so one is you want to change the layout of the map, two isyou want to change the parameters you gave us in terms ofspeed and timing, right? and three, you want to run it,
Conversation Management;so that's what i'm saying this is very very highlevel, this is kind of go and build a map, but there is so manyvariables here that would be very hard ahead of time to naildown unless you actually started doing it, and it would be avery iterative process, because you change this thing, and thatchanges something that, you know that changes, it's all veryrelated.
Conversation Management;so you have green, red, left?turn, and orange
Conversation Management;that's kind of where this stuff lives
Conversation Management;the students are going to realize at some point i think,its probably part of the exercise is the professor wants them to,is that you really want your sequences on a given street tofollow a given pattern that enables traffic flow withoutspeeding, and to actually manually enter all that information ishuge
Conversation Management;then we got street and density possibly speeds
Conversation Management;well we've got the visual map of the area
Conversation Management;well, i mean so the end users seem to be the students, and theprofessor.
Conversation Management;you can only change lights, youcan't change the streets
Conversation Management;and so after we've set up this design, thisinput has some properties to define with it. just going to be theflow in essentially as you described. and then you hit go,
Conversation Management;and so we think about, termination of, do we get flow out of thissystem, do we think about
Conversation Management;and so, you fire off youknow sticking our toe into dirty details, you fire off thread foreach input thing, and then each thread input is doing add a car ata particular flow
Conversation Management;but this defines in the data structure that we don't care.
Conversation Management;covers most of our entities at least. what's going on. how theyinteract.
Conversation Management;it says we have to have a protected left
Conversation Management;looks like basically two pieces: the interaction andthe code for map that's able to manipulate road systems with awhole bunch of details.
Conversation Management;map going to have intersections. and then the intersections
Conversation Management;number of cars andtravel time
Conversation Management;so it's interesting becausethe intersection has signals and the intersection has some controlof the signals.
Conversation Management;so we have r1, and so r1 is
Conversation Management;so we start the simulation and it's going to start addingcars until it stops, then it's going to pull it see if there's moreroom.
Conversation Management;so we've decided that lanes, maybe not so significant
Conversation Management;so we've gotÇ-these are kind of the physicsthings, and kind of the abstract things we've got
Conversation Management;too much about the lanes themselves.
Conversation Management;we've got traffic, intersections,
Conversation Management;we've got, you know kind of this set ofused cases about leftÇ-turn, straights
Conversation Management;you have two end points.
Conversation Management;and you said it would be good to have traffic also visualized,
Conversation Management;and velocity, yesÖ visualize at one time, light, trafficÖ
Other;for now we donít have any traffic, right? we have road density.
Other;if you look on the class diagrams we have these intersections and then we have traffic lights and then we have timing behavior.
Other;letís check the other requirements. Ö sensors, okay, traffic can be defined at each intersection, yes. i have promised to read my own writing, traffic density per road, yes okay thatís fine. velocity, okay, velocity should be one part of the road traffic
Other;letís say in general we already added in blue some additional attributes for the traffic. there could be more in the future, which could be of importance
Other;the road layout. so we have the visualization, we have the model, but we donít have talked too much about
Other;we have all data model, we have the view, we have the sketch
Other;we have talked about the road layout, we have road intersections in four-way but it could be also supporting more in the future, we have traffic lights at the intersections, optional we have the sensor attribute. thatís something we have not drawn again, right? so the sensor attribute is road has sensors, right?
Other;and you said it would be good to have traffic also visualized,
Other;and velocity, yesÖ visualize at one time, light, trafficÖ
Other;because basically are two directions here: up and down or left and right
Other;but then we have 2a so they shouldn't be able to set combinations that would result in a crash so that's
Other;i think it is written in one of the part two: combinations of individual signals that would result in crashes should not be allowed.
Other;i think it says somewhere that all the intersection must have traffic lights and all of them are 4 way so i guess the traffic light arrangement would be the same they will all have.
Other;it says students should be able to change the traffic density that enters the map on a given road
Other;it says that the light behavior should able to change based on the input from the sensors
Other;must be able to design each intersection with or without the option of sensors that detect whether any car are present on a given lane
Other;now again it says all interaction, intersections should be four way,
Other;ok, so the requirements, the first bullet point i think would be done with this
Other;so i think with this we will satisfy the task that a roads should be allowed for both to varying length and place and different arrangements of intersections should be created and it is not restricted to a certain amount of intersections, so this should be fine, i think so
Other;we basically provide the user possibility to draw roads and to simplify drawing intersections we would have different kind of symbols so that the user doesnít have to draw nice roads in arrangement properly but there we have an intersection symbol and perhaps we can also provide and additional intersection symbol to be able to differentiate between sensor equipped intersections and none sensor equipped intersections and for the definition of the behavior we have a simplified model which says, ok basically we have two directions like from left to right and right to left, and up and down and down and up, so these are basically behaving in the same way and then the user can define the timing, how long it should be red or orange and green or from red to orange and from green to orange and then there must be some kind of main traffic light so that we know that we start with this one and the other two traffic lights which are affected by this behave accordingly. so for example after 40 seconds or 42 seconds the cars can drive from right to left or left to right and then again after 100 seconds or whatever it switches again and the beginning of a street the user can click in a certain area and if he clicks there he can define a number of cars he wants to spawn in a certain time at a road and the cars would actually be shown with comparatively nice images of cars, comparable to the ones we created like art and yeah i think if an intersection is sensor equipped, that also takes a simplified model into account, like in this case, if it seems, there is no car in 1 and 3 but cars are waiting or entering the sensor zone in 2 or 4 then it could switch the behavior and put the ones on green and the other ones on red so that we avoid having a long period of waiting cars now there are more cars driving, and i am not sure whether i forgot something but, yeah of course we have a play button to start the simulation and the user can zoom in and zoom out and focus on a certain area of the map equivalent to the smartboard software and yeah, i am not sure whether i forgot something.
Other;if we control whether certain intersections evenallow a [inaudible
Other;i suppose if you just had a list of intersections it goesrandomly too
Other;if it's a single lane of traffic, could those left-êturners andstraight-êthrough-êers be queued up in the same queue
Other;if that state is this, then the otherstates are going to be
Other;if the car at thehead of, well the entrance. i guess
Other;if there's a protected left turn thenthese need to be broken up almost.
Other;if they have an intersection here and here
Other;if this is ourcanvass and that's an onramp and that's an off ramp, youhave a special edge intersection
Other;if this road fills up, then even if this is green,this car won't be able to pass
Other;if we ever really neededthis
Other;if we had some sort of--our network can be representedwith a geometry that's in kind of the window so you canscroll around
Other;if we haveintersection then they know about them
Other;if we make the capacity of the geometry and youcould sort of simulate a highway or something
Other;if we want to
Other;if we want to get more sophisticated wecould have sensor logic taking sensor for each in-êroad so thatif say these two are empty then these two just stay greenforever
Other;if we were playing the roles ofarchitect, how to communicate it to--so we
Other;if you could rearrange the networks to get thatslope, you would have
Other;if you double click you can controlthe frequency of the car creation on that road
Other;if you gothrough that's fine and then through that's fine.
Other;if you have multiple lanesthen you could say the left one is always turning left
Other;if you look at a road. it has a queue, right
Other;if you say you have to start with anonramp
Other;if you're thinking graphically, if this iscapacity and wait time, the capacity is going to be graphedsomething like that
Other;if you're visiting anintersection and a road you don't have to be those thingsthere, all that logic is pretty clear there
Other;if youwant to take control, i'd have you say
Other;ifyou want to make it longer or shorter
Other;it depends if there's two lanes or not.
Other;it's almost as if you need to always start with an onramp sothat
Other;it's not full it would be allowed to
Other;let's supposeto you do here to here onramp, off ramp. and so this pointnow we can get an interior, now we've got an interior.
Other;let'ssuppose we make it so every ten ticks the lights change.well, it might be that every five ticks, the sensor is triggered,or something like that.
Other;maybe ifyou select a car, i mean a road, it allows you to edit
Other;numerical decision data. averagewait time, three hours. and i wonder if we want to allowuser control of a clock in the sense that relating the notion ofthis tick time to real time.
Other;say if this is the head. sothe speed controls, like for every tick how many spaces a carcan move
Other;so let's suppose t onerepresent a delta
Other;so then, so suppose, so we're going to have thecars done in one tic right.
Other;so, let's suppose we start with, say this picture is t zero.what would, okay so they can't, let's suppose for a momentthat t zero has all the lights about to change, so in the sensethat wherever i just point in time nothing's moving and we'reshowing x point in time where something has moved sort ofbefore and after state.
Other;suppose you have even a simulationobject, it has a clock and a network and here's the clock andit tells the clock time
Other;thatif a car went from here--so what we'd see right now in ourvisualization is that in queue we see it pop to the front of thequeue
Other;there might be an implicitstep in the network to say to keep the network modelconstraints by introducing an intersection if it needs to at ajunction
Other;there's rules governing if you have two carsgoing into the same road, which goes first per tick,
Other;this road is geometrically shorter, then thisessentially is saying all roads are the same length
Other;when i hit theplay button, it kicks the ticks going and now we have all ofour random number generators feeding cars into thenetwork
Other;you have an analyticspiece looking in and assessing questions like
Other;you're trying to do the yield, you know trying tosimulate the yield rule, right
Other;, if you click on here and double click on here then there'ssome form that
Other;f south has a green arrow, then
Other;if
Other;if the speed on this street is25mph, adding relay, how long should it take you to go thisdistance
Other;if this is green, then y
Other;if we had alittle more time
Other;if you want tosimulate it, you have to know
Other;then
Other;youhave the instance of the car, the car knows where it's going. sothe car comes, and does some sort of hand?shaking with theroad and the road knows it has this
Other;if it doesn't have a sensor it just assumes, justignores the poll
Other;if we continue the hierarchy of the signals, the rules
Other;if you envisioned some sort of[inaudible] package then there'd be sort of this thing you knowthey'd drop a leftÇ-turn signal in there, and a straight signal
Other;if you have a light dictating left, it's always goingto be a left turn and straight and more often
Other;if it blocks, the queue tells it hey i'mfull, that thread has to stop you know and then it's got to pull it tomake it go again
Other;if some carhere is wanting to go straight and this is backed up, they cannot
Other;if the queue is empty on the road, don't trigger it green
Other;if theres a one way road, so basically there's only one endpoint on this road
Other;if theres no traffic
Other;if there's no traffic, neverturn it green.
Other;if this road fills up, it's going to have to know i'm full, i can'taccept anymore traffic coming down my way.
Other;if we just say has the car,and then the rules come in here whether it's sensored or nonsensored.
Other;if we make the assumption that we're not going to have so a twolaneroad that turns into a oneÇ-lane road, i think we're fineÇ-
Other;if we think about, you know,somebody is going to say start feeding cars in here, and then thisguy has to say hey i'm full, stop
Other;if you have one lane, you don't really run intoreality
Other;if you're going to get back up here youcould potentially back it up into the next intersection dependingon this length here which is going to
Other;if you'renot, if you don't want a sensor, they said they can have withoutsensors, then it's completely time based.
Other;if youthink of this as kind of an encapsulated entity then it's not goingto know about this.
Other;ifyou have a full lane everywhere in the intersection so everythingfits they're two lanes at that point.
Other;mean if you think of, you know desktop or
Other;so if an intersection has a sensor, thenÇ-i think is that assimple as this intersection having api with the road calls?
Other;this has a length, it never overflows, you know iften, five cars can fit then it's all
Other;you follow thepercentage model then we can just calculate what that wouldmean for the entry source of cars coming in.
Other;i mean if we view a road that is the whole thing, the whole map, i mean it could have multiple intersections,
Other;if later on we have something not just four way but with this t-crossing, then we should easily be able to support this
Other;if the map is changing in a way that you add another intersection in between the appearances of roads are recalculated, but this then is a letís say more complex part and you need to copy the attributes and so on so it shouldnít be so difficult
Other;if the system is working, then additional things will be requested and itís better to have it already separated instead of putting all in one class
Other;if we are going for a more model-view-controller pattern or something like that maybe we want to separate the visualization in some sense
Other;if we want to make it more advanced in the future like you said with the more detailed definition of traffic for which kind of cars and so on we already have the right entry
Other;if we want to take the five we can make it even easier and say that roads have a single attribute saying density or something like that
Other;if you follow the assignment i mean there is specifically mentioned traffic density for the roads, but then it wonít be as easy to calculate something like system throughput or anything like that so it could also be hard to simulate letís say the time it takes for a single car from point a to point b
Other;if you move the intersection the road will become longer so i guess the velocity will have a different impact on the total throughput.
Other;if you want to evaluate traffic, evaluate the performance of the traffic lights as a system itself
Other;mean if you only have one visual element then there is no point for it
Other;so if we donít have any traffic model per se we are only talking about how much density there is on a single road
Conversation Management;so then if i add a third road, then i would have this
Conversation Management;i mean if we view a road that is the whole thing, the whole map, i mean it could have multiple intersections,
Conversation Management;if later on we have something not just four way but with this t-crossing, then we should easily be able to support this
Conversation Management;if the map is changing in a way that you add another intersection in between the appearances of roads are recalculated, but this then is a letís say more complex part and you need to copy the attributes and so on so it shouldnít be so difficult
Conversation Management;if the system is working, then additional things will be requested and itís better to have it already separated instead of putting all in one class
Conversation Management;if we are going for a more model-view-controller pattern or something like that maybe we want to separate the visualization in some sense
Conversation Management;if we want to make it more advanced in the future like you said with the more detailed definition of traffic for which kind of cars and so on we already have the right entry
Conversation Management;if we want to take the five we can make it even easier and say that roads have a single attribute saying density or something like that
Conversation Management;if you follow the assignment i mean there is specifically mentioned traffic density for the roads, but then it wonít be as easy to calculate something like system throughput or anything like that so it could also be hard to simulate letís say the time it takes for a single car from point a to point b
Conversation Management;if you move the intersection the road will become longer so i guess the velocity will have a different impact on the total throughput.
Conversation Management;if you want to evaluate traffic, evaluate the performance of the traffic lights as a system itself
Conversation Management;mean if you only have one visual element then there is no point for it
Conversation Management;so if we donít have any traffic model per se we are only talking about how much density there is on a single road
Conversation Management;if it was green before, we have to change
Conversation Management;if we select
Conversation Management;if we, first time when you draw something and then try to play
Conversation Management;meant that if we want to detect it automatically we have to say
Conversation Management;if the user has to use the intersection symbol then we could definitely do it like this
Conversation Management;if you assign like some kind of ids or whatsoever to the traffic light then perhaps one traffic light could reference another traffic light and the theoretically.
Conversation Management;if you draw road here it should, you should be
Conversation Management;if you know it then you can take it into account
Conversation Management;if you set, if you set the one with the arrow, if you set that one to being green 30 seconds then you know that that one the other one is up and down right
Conversation Management;if you will start simulation
Conversation Management;mean if we consider our example, i mean in some way, letís just
Conversation Management;so create a crash if this car would drive here
Conversation Management;so if you can set how long the one that you draw an arrow to if she said this one to 20 seconds green and maybe orange or yellow,
Conversation Management;assess the load on an9intersection
Conversation Management;okay so it says that's up to us
Conversation Management;was thinking, up to this point we'vesaid intersections contain the roads
Conversation Management;, it saysstudents must be able to describe the behavior of trafficlights on each of the intersection so that's maybe building uifor this intersection piece where we allow the user to set atime, or set a--
Conversation Management;2c says students should be able to design eachintersection with or without the option of sensors
Conversation Management;a couple more advanced details is there's the left-êhand turn
Conversation Management;and nowshould we try
Conversation Management;and then come up with progressively--start off with thesimplest user story, and then progressively add user stories3and then maybe have pictures to illustrate how in our systemthose user stories will be achieved
Conversation Management;at least we can go through it right now. a few tables
Conversation Management;by now we select the intersection, you couldgo to the analytics now. there's a coloring of theintersection as it grows and then the specifics of theanalytics
Conversation Management;fifteen minutes into documenting,talking about the engineering design, code structure
Conversation Management;get a little more sophisticated.
Conversation Management;i guess the other thing that would be--the other big piecehere is analytics,
Conversation Management;i guess we should write some of these things down.
Conversation Management;i was thinking we could startwith what we have now and fall on a user story of runningthis simulation now.
Conversation Management;i'm sort of reminded of the fact that we're supposed to allowlights to have sets of rules
Conversation Management;i'm wondering with half an hour left if we need to thinkabout how to--
Conversation Management;it does say...here, every intersection on the map must havetraffic signals, all intersections will be four way. there are not-êintersections. nor one-êway roads.
Conversation Management;i've got some ideas around intersections androads
Conversation Management;let's go back to the model6for a second
Conversation Management;let's sketch a ui
Conversation Management;maybe we can peg that for the moment and introducethat as we flush this out
Conversation Management;maybe we can peg that for the moment and introducethat as we flush this out.
Conversation Management;maybe we can use this space.
Conversation Management;maybe we should start talking about the u
Conversation Management;okay so students should be ableto choose... students should be able to observe any progress4with their map's timing scheme--okay so that comes back toanalytics
Conversation Management;okay this is getting morecomplicated
Conversation Management;one thing i didn't think of is the popping,
Conversation Management;random number generator is controlling push. andthat happens for every tick.
Conversation Management;should we start soon?
Conversation Management;so basic--design a basic structure of code.so to me, that's where we've got the model. the model anda little bit of how controller controls the model.
Conversation Management;so it says here students should be able to choose the trafficdensity they're interested in on a given road
Conversation Management;so should we talk about end [inaudible
Conversation Management;so this is kind of like our cop rules, right
Conversation Management;so tick happens and changes time, cop is watchingtime
Conversation Management;start, pause, reset. then maybe thenext one will be added on to observe
Conversation Management;that's what we'rekind of doing here
Conversation Management;we have some constraints on the flow of
Conversation Management;we have the notion ofqueuing and de-êqueuing
Conversation Management;we need to design the basic structure of the code thatwill be used to implement the system.
Conversation Management;we now have two 1types of car. straight-êthrough guy and left-êturn, right turn,left-êturn.
Conversation Management;well it does say that something that the user couldcontrol
Conversation Management;well it says the student must be able to simulate traffic flowson the map. students should be able to change the trafficdensity that enters the map on a given road.
Conversation Management;well let's stick to the grid
Conversation Management;well now, intersection class
Conversation Management;we'll tackle that when we get there
Conversation Management;well we can write that down
Conversation Management;what we have in our model so far is intersectionthat has the light
Conversation Management;where's the first place to start?
Conversation Management;yeah maybe let's start with thenetwork
Conversation Management;and it says there is some package that has some understandingof how speeds
Conversation Management;basically we have three differentóthere's editing themap, building the map is one mode. and then there's buildingthe simulation betweenóand we could use the map too
Conversation Management;but we don't have enoughinformation here. there might be packages out there
Conversation Management;didn't get to the sensors at all
Conversation Management;does the professor want the students to learn that through trialand error
Conversation Management;goal is that as many cars are moving at any given time asclose to speed limit as possible
Conversation Management;have up to six intersections.
Conversation Management;here
Conversation Management;his is always the point where i'm scared toerase the board. we need to take a picture of that.
Conversation Management;i told you the streets, intersections,left and right, i told you traffic patterns, you figure out what thelights are.
Conversation Management;it said we can figure that out.
Conversation Management;it's kind of like i go back, like what is exactly theoutput, you kno
Conversation Management;it's messier than usual whiteboards.
Conversation Management;letme erase over here. it's this stuff that i'm worried about. it'skind of sketchy.
Conversation Management;lets assume this, lets assume it's inside a city so...
Conversation Management;lets see, lets see
Conversation Management;oh okay, in the idealcase, the amount of time people spend waiting is minimized bythe chosen settings for the given intersection's traffic lights.
Conversation Management;okay we've assigned speeds,we've moved the roads, we draw the roads, inspectintersections and lights, okay
Conversation Management;okay, create visual map, clean up roads and pattern ofchoosing...
Conversation Management;so one is you want to change the layout of the map, two isyou want to change the parameters you gave us in terms ofspeed and timing, right? and three, you want to run it,
Conversation Management;so that's what i'm saying this is very very highlevel, this is kind of go and build a map, but there is so manyvariables here that would be very hard ahead of time to naildown unless you actually started doing it, and it would be avery iterative process, because you change this thing, and thatchanges something that, you know that changes, it's all veryrelated.
Conversation Management;so you have green, red, left?turn, and orange
Conversation Management;summarize the unclaritiesthat we had for professor e
Conversation Management;that's kind of where this stuff lives
Conversation Management;the students are going to realize at some point i think,its probably part of the exercise is the professor wants them to,is that you really want your sequences on a given street tofollow a given pattern that enables traffic flow withoutspeeding, and to actually manually enter all that information ishuge
Conversation Management;then cars
Conversation Management;then we got street and density possibly speeds
Conversation Management;this is something where i'd go back to the customer and tryand figure out
Conversation Management;this is when i pull out my camera
Conversation Management;this is why we need to check with theprofessor again
Conversation Management;well and i can also see how, in either case
Conversation Management;well we've got the visual map of the area
Conversation Management;well, i mean so the end users seem to be the students, and theprofessor.
Conversation Management;well, i was going to leave the arrow out fo
Conversation Management;where are you drawing
Conversation Management;yeah, i feel like this stuff over here
Conversation Management;you can only change lights, youcan't change the streets
Conversation Management;let's see what other data do we pull out
Conversation Management;and since it's a multiÇ-intersection problem
Conversation Management;and so after we've set up this design, thisinput has some properties to define with it. just going to be theflow in essentially as you described. and then you hit go,
Conversation Management;and so we think about, termination of, do we get flow out of thissystem, do we think about
Conversation Management;and so, you fire off youknow sticking our toe into dirty details, you fire off thread foreach input thing, and then each thread input is doing add a car ata particular flow
Conversation Management;but this defines in the data structure that we don't care.
Conversation Management;call it a [inaudible] requirement. cool. let's check for anyother...
Conversation Management;concerned with too much detail before weevenÇ-otherwise we're going to cut stuff out.
Conversation Management;covers most of our entities at least. what's going on. how theyinteract.
Conversation Management;figure out if roads connect tointersections, traffic contains, lets think about containment a littlebit here
Conversation Management;i think we haveÇ-we can probably numerate the rules we'regoing to need too.
Conversation Management;i want to start by hearing your summary of this
Conversation Management;it says we have to have a protected left
Conversation Management;let's dive into that a little bit.
Conversation Management;let's explore that
Conversation Management;lets look for error
Conversation Management;let's put it in there and we'll capture that.
Conversation Management;let's take that oneout
Conversation Management;let'sfocus on kind of
Conversation Management;looks like basically two pieces: the interaction andthe code for map that's able to manipulate road systems with awhole bunch of details.
Conversation Management;map going to have intersections. and then the intersections
Conversation Management;next question
Conversation Management;number of cars andtravel time
Conversation Management;rules for the signals.
Conversation Management;so it's interesting becausethe intersection has signals and the intersection has some controlof the signals.
Conversation Management;so let's hide that detail. [inaudible].
Conversation Management;so nowcome back up, what big concepts haven't we captured yet
Conversation Management;so we have r1, and so r1 is
Conversation Management;so we start the simulation and it's going to start addingcars until it stops, then it's going to pull it see if there's moreroom.
Conversation Management;so we've decided that lanes, maybe not so significant
Conversation Management;so we've gotÇ-these are kind of the physicsthings, and kind of the abstract things we've got
Conversation Management;start twoengineers on the model, one engineer on the ui. get the modelgoing ahead. cool.
Conversation Management;the next step i would do is to
Conversation Management;too much about the lanes themselves.
Conversation Management;we need to think about the big picture
Conversation Management;we should model that
Conversation Management;we've got traffic, intersections,
Conversation Management;we've got, you know kind of this set ofused cases about leftÇ-turn, straights
Conversation Management;you have two end points.
Conversation Management;and you said it would be good to have traffic also visualized,
Conversation Management;guess we are also finished regarding the time, i guess we can stop here.
Conversation Management;i guess we can just restart
Conversation Management;i mean best we have 20 minutes.
Conversation Management;it could be some kind of traffic connected but we can also just leave it for now
Conversation Management;maybe we can remove it afterwards for other discussions?
Conversation Management;say okay we do a different tree on the right side which is just the overall items and these could be specific items which are road.
Conversation Management;should we go lower again and restart from the beginning, i donít think itís too difficult.
Conversation Management;ah okay, we have some time left. thirty minutes, okay
Conversation Management;and velocity, yesÖ visualize at one time, light, trafficÖ
Conversation Management;but i just mark it blue to say we think it would be useful and should we go in this direction but to make a clear difference to what was our initial purpose regarding the requirements
Conversation Management;but i would make a statement like, what is it, zoom out, view and the model ad in between there should be some kind of controller, i put it here.
Conversation Management;but it really relates to exactly how ambitious we are
Conversation Management;but this should be something we keep in mind saying thatÖ maybe i can write it here that this needs to be recalculated
Conversation Management;do we have other items we are currently missing?
Conversation Management;for now we donít have any traffic, right? we have road density.
Conversation Management;how longÖ should we do this to 10.30?
Conversation Management;how much time is left? 10.30?
Conversation Management;i can also do it in blue as it is not part of the requirements.
Conversation Management;i mean letís take your example here. let me draw
Conversation Management;i think, i mean from the mental point of view i mean we are more or less done even if we define the controller and some use cases itís more boiler plate type of things.
Conversation Management;i will draw traffic, traffic light and traffic light behavior in parallel
Conversation Management;i would say itís too much, we donít get this done in time.
Conversation Management;i would take something like blue to highlight something which is currently not directly in the requirements
Conversation Management;if you look on the class diagrams we have these intersections and then we have traffic lights and then we have timing behavior.
Conversation Management;later on we could also have this for the purposes you have described that all the attributes of the car like length or speed could influence the traffic at all.
Conversation Management;letís check the other requirements. Ö sensors, okay, traffic can be defined at each intersection, yes. i have promised to read my own writing, traffic density per road, yes okay thatís fine. velocity, okay, velocity should be one part of the road traffic
Conversation Management;letís say in general we already added in blue some additional attributes for the traffic. there could be more in the future, which could be of importance
Conversation Management;maybe for now itís fine in that way.
Conversation Management;maybe thatís also something that we cannot design right now in time
Conversation Management;maybe we check again the requirements, just go maybe through what we have or if we have everything.
Conversation Management;not that i can think of, maybe we can read the requirements again.
Conversation Management;now we can move it.
Conversation Management;okay then maybe letís check again the requirements
Conversation Management;so itís currently maybe a question how much is really necessary
Conversation Management;so maybe we draw this and then we make a component diagram sketch on saying which items we would put together and thatís it
Conversation Management;so maybe you start to do something and then i will continue that
Conversation Management;suspect we are going to have a lot of use cases, not sure we have the time for that.
Conversation Management;the road layout. so we have the visualization, we have the model, but we donít have talked too much about
Conversation Management;then i will remove it again
Conversation Management;this is also why i would do this in blue meaning this could also be an additional information
Conversation Management;this is where iím thinking about kind of which view we should have on this,
Conversation Management;we have all data model, we have the view, we have the sketch
Conversation Management;we have talked about the road layout, we have road intersections in four-way but it could be also supporting more in the future, we have traffic lights at the intersections, optional we have the sensor attribute. thatís something we have not drawn again, right? so the sensor attribute is road has sensors, right?
Conversation Management;what is the next?
Conversation Management;what was the timing? how much time is left for the design phase? (asking andreas) who?
Conversation Management;yes i would say letís start easy and we can add additional things later on
Conversation Management;ah no, this is not working
Conversation Management;ah, ok, so i donít know why, at least we can both draw
Conversation Management;ah, yes, ok, itís fine, so once again i will also try to draw something, ok?
Conversation Management;and further we figure to, i mean we can delete it afterwards.
Conversation Management;because basically are two directions here: up and down or left and right
Conversation Management;but ok, should we leave the main window as it is. i have it as a paper in my hand
Conversation Management;but then we have 2a so they shouldn't be able to set combinations that would result in a crash so that's
Conversation Management;first of should we both zoom out to the maximum so that we always see everything?
Conversation Management;having sensors in the street.
Conversation Management;i donít think so
Conversation Management;i think it is written in one of the part two: combinations of individual signals that would result in crashes should not be allowed.
Conversation Management;i think it says somewhere that all the intersection must have traffic lights and all of them are 4 way so i guess the traffic light arrangement would be the same they will all have.
Conversation Management;i think thatís everything to be said.
Conversation Management;i think this should be the only issue right now
Conversation Management;i thought i was drawing again, perhaps we need to activate the mouse again
Conversation Management;it says students should be able to change the traffic density that enters the map on a given road
Conversation Management;it says that the light behavior should able to change based on the input from the sensors
Conversation Management;just let me draw something again
Conversation Management;mean first we can assign numbers here to be able to talk about it.
Conversation Management;must be able to design each intersection with or without the option of sensors that detect whether any car are present on a given lane
Conversation Management;now again it says all interaction, intersections should be four way,
Conversation Management;ok
Conversation Management;ok what we are missing right now is the sensor, is there anything else what we are missing right now, despite the sensors?
Conversation Management;ok, finger works
